== Keeping your automation code maintainable

In Chapter 7 we refined the Gherkin of the Premium Accounts feature, turning what had started out as nothing more than an automated test into some valuable documentation.

As we did that, we _pushed the "how" down_, making the scenarios themselves more declarative of the desired behaviour, pushing the implementation details of the testing into the code in the step defintions below.

This traded off more readable, maintainable and useful scenarios for more complex automation code. In this chapter we'll show you how to organise your automation code so that you won't be afraid of making this trade-off.
