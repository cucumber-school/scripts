So we have our failing scenario:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec cucumber
Feature: Hear shout

  Scenario: Listener is within range         # features/hear_shout.feature:2
    Given Lucy is located 15m from Sean      # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:4
    When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's" # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:10
    Then Lucy hears Sean’s message           # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:15
      expected [] to include "free bagels at Sean's" (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/steps.rb:16:in `"Lucy hears Sean’s message"'
      features/hear_shout.feature:5:in `Then Lucy hears Sean’s message'

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/hear_shout.feature:2 # Scenario: Listener is within range

1 scenario (1 failed)
3 steps (1 failed, 2 passed)

Lucy is expected to hear Sean's message, but she hasn't heard anything: we got an empty Array back from the `messages_heard` method.

In this case, we’re going to cheat. We have a one-line fix that will make this scenario pass, but it’s not a particularly future-proof implementation. Can you guess what it is?

[source,ruby]
----
module Shouty
  class Person
    def move_to(distance)
      
    end

    def shout(message)
      
    end

    def messages_heard
      ["free bagels at Sean's"]
    end
  end
end
----

I told you it wasn’t very future proof!

Woohoo! Our scenario is passing for the first time. As long as this is the only message anyone ever shouts, we're good to ship this thing!

Now, the fact that such a poor implementation can pass our tests shows us that we need to work on our tests. A more comprehensive set of scenarios would guide us towards a better implementation.

It's also a good habit to look for the most simple solution. We can trust that, as our scenarios evolve, so will our solution.

This is the essence of Behaviour-Driven Development. Examples of behaviour drive the development. We do just enough to make the next scenario pass, and no more.

Instead of writing a note on our TODO list, let's write another scenario that shouts a different message. It will fail, reminding us we need to find a solution that doesn't rely on hard-coding the message.

Feature: Hear shout
  Scenario: Listener is within range
    Given Lucy is located 15m from Sean
    When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's"
    Then Lucy hears Sean’s message

  Scenario: Listener hears a different message
    Given Lucy is located 15m from Sean
    When Sean shouts "Free coffee!"
    Then Lucy hears Sean's message
----

Now when we come back to this code, we can just run the tests and Cucumber will remind us what we need to do next. We're done for today!

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec cucumber
# TODO: add correct output
----

Of course, if you're in the mood, you can always try to implement a solution yourself that makes both scenarios pass. Have fun!
