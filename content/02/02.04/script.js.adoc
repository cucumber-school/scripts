We need to create a `features` directory. This is the conventional place to store your Gherkin specifications.

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir features
----

shot::[2]
Now we’re ready to create our first feature file. Call the file `hear_shout.feature`

[source,bash]
----
$ touch features/hear_shout.feature
----

shot::[3]
All feature files start with the keyword `Feature:`
shot::[4]
followed by a name.
It’s a good convention to give it a name that matches the file name.

Now let’s write out our first scenario.

This is the one where the listener is within range, shot::[5] Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean, shot::[6] Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's", shot::[7] Lucy hears Sean's message. shot::[8]

.hear_shout.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
include::../code/js/02-feature-file-created/features/hear_shout.feature[]
----

shot::[9]
Save the file, switch back to the command-prompt and run `npm test`. You’ll see Cucumber has found our feature file and read it back to us. We can see a summary of the results at the bottom: one scenario,shot::[10] three steps - all undefined.shot::[11]

_Undefined_` means Cucumber doesn’t know what to do for any of the three steps we wrote in our Gherkin scenario. It needs us to provide some _step definitions_.

shot::[11.1, "02.04.animation.mp4"]

Step definitions translate from the plain language you use in Gherkin into JavaScript code.

When Cucumber runs a step, it looks for a step definition that matches the text in the step. If it finds one, then it executes the code in the step definition.

If it doesn’t find one… well, you’ve just seen what happens. Cucumber helpfully prints out some code snippets that we can use as a basis for new step definitions.

Let’s copy those to create our first step definitions.

shot::[12]shot::[13]
We’ll paste them into a JavaScript file under a new directory called `step_definitions` underneath the `features` directory. I’ll just call it `steps.js`.

We need to import the `Given`, shot::[13] `When` shot::[14] and `Then` shot::[15] keywords from the `cucumber` package.shot::[16]

.steps.js
[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/03-pending-steps/features/step_definitions/steps.js[]
----

shot::[17]
Now we run Cucumber again.

This time the output is a little different. We now have a pending step shot::[18] and two skipped ones.shot::[19] This means Cucumber found all our step definitions, and executed the first one.

shot::[20]
But that first step definition returns `'pending'`, which causes Cucumber to stop, skip the rest of the steps, and mark the scenario as pending.

Now that we've wired up our step definitions to the Gherkin steps, it's almost time to start working on our solution. First though, let's tidy up the generated code.

We'll rename the `int` parameter to something that better reflects its meaning. Let's call it `distance`.shot::[21]

And we can print it to the terminal to see the captured result

Notice that the number 15 does not appear anywhere in our code. The value is automatically passed from the Gherkin step to the step definition. If you're curious, that’s the shot::[24]`{int}` in the step definition pattern or _cucumber expression_. We’ll explain these patterns in detail in a future lesson.
