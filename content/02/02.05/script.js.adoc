Now that we have the step definitions matching, we can start working on our solution. We like to use our scenarios to _guide_ our development, so we'll start designing the objects we'll need by sketching out some code in our step definitions.

The scenario will be failing while we do this, but we should see the error messages gradually progressing as we drive out the interface to our object model.

Our next goal is for the scenario to fail because we need to implement the actual business logic. _Then_ we can work on changing the business logic inside our objects to make it pass.

.steps.js
[source,js]
----
const { Given, When, Then } = require('cucumber')

Given('Lucy is located {int} metres from Sean', function (distance) {
  console.log(distance)
  return 'pending'
})

When('Sean shouts {string}', function (string) {
  // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  return 'pending'
})

Then('Lucy hears Sean’s message', function () {
  // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  return 'pending'
})
----

To implement the first step, we need to create a couple of `Person` objects,shot::[2] with the specified distance between them. shot::[3] We can remove the `pending` status now,shot::[4] and this `console.log` statement,shot::[5] and write the implementation for the first step like this:

.steps.js
[source,js]
----
Given('Lucy is located {int} metres from Sean', function (distance) {
  this.lucy = new Person
  this.sean = new Person
  this.lucy.moveTo(distance)
})
----

We have two instances of person, one representing Lucy, shot::[6]and one representing Sean. shot::[7]Then we call a method to move Lucy to the position specified in the scenario.shot::[8]

shot::[8.1, "02.05.animation.mp4"]

To keep things simple, we're going to assume all people are situated on a line: a one-dimensional co-ordinate system. We can always introduce proper geo-locations later. We'll place Sean in the centre, and Lucy 15 metres away from Sean.

This might not be the design we'll end up with once this is all working, but it's a decent place to start.

shot::[9]
If we run Cucumber, we’ll see a compilation error from JavaScript: we need to define our `Person` class.shot::[10]

Let’s give our solution a home by creating a `src` directory.
shot::[12]
We’ll put our Shouty application in a JavaScript file called `shouty.js` in that directory.

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir src
$ touch src/shouty.js

Then we can  create an empty `Person` class, shot::[13] and export it.shot::[14]

.src/shouty.js
[source,js]
----
class Person {

}

module.exports = Person
----

shot::[15]
For now, we’ll just require the `Person` class from our `steps.js` file. In a later lesson we’ll talk more about how to organise this code a bit better.

[source,js]

const Person = require('../../src/shouty.js')
const { Given, When, Then } = require('cucumber');

We're making progress! 

We'll keep working like this until we see the scenario failing for the right reasons.

In the second step definition, we want to tell Sean to shout something.

shot::[21]
In order to send instructions to Sean, we need to store him in an property, which we already have, so that he’ll be accessible from all of our step definitions.

shot::[22]
In the `When` step, we're capturing Sean's message using the `{string}` pattern, and pass an argument to the function. We'll call it `message`.shot::[23]

shot::[24]
And now we can now tell him to _shout_ the message:

[source,js]
----
Given('Lucy is located {int} metres from Sean', function (distance) {
  this.lucy = new Person
  this.sean = new Person
  this.lucy.moveTo(distance)
})

When('Sean shouts {string}', function (message) {
  this.sean.shout(message)
});

shot::[25]
If we run Cucumber, it's telling is that our `Person` class needs a `shout` method.

Let’s not worry about the implementation yet. The most important thing right now is to discover the shape of our domain model.

.shouty.rb
[source,js]
----
class Person {
  moveTo(distance) {
    
  }

  shout(message) {
    
  }
}
----

And now the second step is green: shot::[27]

[source,bash]
----
$ npm test

> shouty@1.0.0 test /home/fedex/code/shouty
> cucumber-js -f node_modules/cucumber-pretty

Feature: Hear shout

  Scenario: Listener is within range
    Given Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean
    When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's"
    Then Lucy hears Sean’s message
    ? pending

shot::[28]
The last step definition is where we implement a check, or assertion. We’ll verify that what Lucy has heard is exactly the same as what Sean shouted.

shot::[29]
Once again we’re are going to write the code we wish we had.

But before, we need to import `assertThat` shot::[30] and `is` shot::[31] from `hamjest`shot::[32]

[source,js]
----
const { assertThat, is } = require('hamjest')

// ...

Then('Lucy hears Sean’s message', function () {
  assertThat(this.lucy.messagesHeard(), is([this.message]))
});
----

So we need a way to ask Lucy what messages she’s heard, and we also need to know what it was that Sean shouted.

shot::[33]
We can record what Sean shouts by storing it in the `this.message` property as the `When` step runs. This is a common pattern to use in Cucumber step definitions when you don’t want to repeat the same test data in different parts of a scenario. Now we can use that in the assertion check.

[source,js]
----
When('Sean shouts {string}', function (message) {
  this.sean.shout(message)
  this.message = message
});
----

shot::[34]
We also need to add a `messagesHeard` method to our Person class. Let’s do that now, we'll just return an empty array for now shot::[35]

[source,js]
----
class Person {
  moveTo() {
    
  }

  shout(message) {
    
  }

  messagesHeard() {
    return []
  }
}
----

shot::[36]

This is great! Whenever we do BDD, getting to our first failing test is a milestone. Seeing the test fail proves that it is capable of detecting errors in our code!

Never trust an automated test that you haven’t seen fail!

Now all we have to do is write the code to make it do what it's supposed to.
