When you follow this principle, your step definitions become a translation layer from plain language into code. By keeping the vocabulary consistent as you move across the problem-solution boundary, you start to allow the scenarios to drive the design of your domain model. This is what we call modelling by example.

In this way, we create our own API for automating our application. As this API grows, it becomes easier and easier to write new step definitions, because the actions you need to take are already defined on the API.

It might seem like over-engineering on our little Shouty application, but youâ€™ll be surprised how quickly these test suites grow. Taking time to stamp out complexity early  and organise your code to create a good support API is a great investment for the future.
