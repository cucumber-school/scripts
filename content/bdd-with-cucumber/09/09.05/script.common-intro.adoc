As your test suite grows, you can end up with hundreds of step defintiions, and keeping them all in a single file becomes a maintenance nightmare.

A great benefit of delegating to a support layer is that we can start to organise our step definitions into multiple files, with any step function being able to access the same state and methods on the World, or other support layer objects.
