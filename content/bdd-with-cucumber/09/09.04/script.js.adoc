We need a new directory to contain our support code. the conventional place to put it is here, in a `support` directory underneath `features`. shot::[1]

[source, sh]
----
mkdir features/support
----

There’s a special file in `features/support` that Cucumber always loads first, called `env.js` shot::[2] (or `env.ts`, if you're using Typescript). You can use this to boot up the system that you’re testing.

[source, sh]
----
touch features/support/env.js
----

In this case, our system is just a domain model, so there isn't really anything to do in order to boot it up.

Still, it's useful to have this `env.js` file because we can use it to set up one-time configuration that all of our scenarios will need.

The most obvious duplication in the step definition code is for shouting a message. shot::[3]

[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/03-create-custom-world/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=25..31]
----

First, we call the `shouter` domain model `Person` object to send the message,shot::[4] and then we cache that message in `this.messagesShoutedBy` so that we'll be able to use it for validation later on.shot::[5]

shot::[5.1]

On it's own, this wouldn't be a problem, but there are four other step definitions for various kinds of shouts that all duplicate this same code.

Let’s imagine we had a helper method we could call like this, instead. Wouldn’t that be neater? shot::[6]

[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/04-extract-shout-helper-to-world/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=25..28]
----

So how would we add this `shout` method to `this`?shot::[7] What even _is_ `this` in the context of a Cucumber step definition function? In order to understand that, we need to learn about a concept called _The World_.

==== The World

Every time Cucumber runs a scenario, it creates a new object, called the _World_. We can define the new world class in our `env.js` support file that we just created.shot::[8].

Each step definition function runs in the context of a new instance of the world, almost as though it were a method on that object. We can customise the methods available on the world (and so the methods available to the step defintions) by first defining them on a JavaScript class,shot::[9] then calling Cucumber's `setWorldConstructor` method to tell it to use that class when constructing new instances of the world. shot::[10]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/03-create-custom-world/features/support/env.js[]
----

Finally, we define our new helper method on this module and paste in the code from the step definition. shot::[11]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/04-extract-shout-helper-to-world/features/support/env.js[lines=3..10]
----

Let’s run Cucumber to check everything’s still working… shot::[12]

include::../code/js/05-use-shout-helper-everywhere/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=30..54]

...and check we haven’t broken anything… shot::[14] Done!

==== Move `this.messagesShoutedBy` property behind a getter

Notice that the helper method we extracted uses that `this.messagesShoutedBy` property.shot::[15]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/05-use-shout-helper-everywhere/features/support/env.js[lines=3..10]
----

We're using this instance variable in this assertion step shot::[16]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/05-use-shout-helper-everywhere/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=68..73]
----

One problem with the current approach is that we're assuming that `this.messagesShoutedBy` is always initialized as an object. If it wasn't, we'd get errors like `cannot read property "Sean" of undefined` from our step definitions.

Currently, we mitigate this risk by initializing the property in a `Before` hook: shot::[17]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/05-use-shout-helper-everywhere/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=8..11]
----

Instead of doing this, we can explicitly make `messagesShoutedBy` a property of the `World`, by defining a getter for it: shot::[17]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/06-push-messagesshoutedby-behind-a-getter-in-world/features/support/env.js[lines=3..6]
----

The getter uses a private variable for the value of the property, initializing it with an empty object if it’s never been accessed before. shot::[19]

Now we no longer need to initialize it in this before hook. shot::[20]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/06-push-messagesshoutedby-behind-a-getter-in-world/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=8..10]
----

And run cucumber to check we’re still green. shot::[21]

[source,sh]
----
npm test

==== Move `this.network` property behind a helper method

We can follow the same steps for the `this.network` property.shot::[22] First, make the accessor method: shot::[23]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/07-move-network-to-a-getter-in-world/features/support/env.js[lines=11..13]
----

This will enable the `{person}` parameter type transformer to pull a `network` as soon as it needs one: shot::[24]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/07-move-network-to-a-getter-in-world/features/support/person_parameter.js[lines=10..10]
----

So we don't need to create a `Network` in a `Before` hook anymore.shot::[25]

In fact, we can delete the `Before` hook altogether.shot::[26]

This is changing the behaviour slightly, and for the better. Now we're not relying on timing - assuming that the hook has created the `Network` at a particular point in the scenario's lifecycle. We just create the `Network` as we need it. This is called _Lazy loading_.

There's one other place where we're using the `Network`, in this step: shot::[27]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/07-move-network-to-a-getter-in-world/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=6..8]
----

Here, we're trying to change the range of the network, and the only way to do that at the moment is to create a brand new instance of `Network`. This code won't work at the moment, because it's trying to set a `network` property on the World, but we don't have a setter for it.

All the way through this lesson, we've been _pushing the how down_, moving the implementation details down from step defintions into our automation support code. Here, we can move the implementation right down into our domain model.

Imagine we had a `range` setter method on our `Network` that allowed us to modify the range on the fly. Then, our step would just look like this: shot::[28]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/09-use-new-network-range-method/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=4..6]
----

Isn't that better?

Let's do it!

First, we'll add a unit test for the `Network` class: shot::[29]

[source,javascript]
----
include::../code/js/08-add-a-way-to-change-the-network-s-range/test/network.test.js[lines=64..74]
----

We'll create a couple of people on the Network, which defaults to a range of 100, so they're going to be close enough to hear each other at the moment. shot::[30]

We'll broadcast a shout from Sean, which Lucy should be able to hear.shot::[31]

Now, we can try setting the range to something much shorter, like 5, so that Sean will now be out of range.shot::[32]

Broadcast again, and this time Lucy shouldn't have heard anything.shot::[33]

Let's run the test, and watch it fail like good TDD practitioners.shot::[34]

[source,sh]
