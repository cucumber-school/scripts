===== When is the state of the World reset?

* We get a brand new instance of the World every time a step definition is invoked
* We get one new instance for every scenario (*Correct*)
* We get the same instance for the whole test suite

Explanation:

Cucumber will create new instances of the World for each scenario. Every step defininition, parameter type or hook will receive the same instance during that scenario.
