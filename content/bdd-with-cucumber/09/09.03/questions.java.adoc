==== Lesson 3 - Questions

===== When we ask dependency injection for an instance of an object:

* We get a brand new instance every time
* We get one new instance for every scenario (*Correct*)
* We get the same instance for the whole test suite

Explanation:

Assuming everything is configured correctly, your dependency injection framework will create new instances of objects for each scenario. Every class that uses dependency injection will get the same instance of a given class during the lifetime of that scenario.
