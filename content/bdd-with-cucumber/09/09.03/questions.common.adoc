==== Lesson 3 - Questions

===== Why do we run the unit tests before the acceptance tests?

* If the unit tests are failing, it's unlikely that the acceptance tests will pass (*Correct*)
* Unit tests are better than acceptance tests
* Acceptance tests are always faster so we leave them until the end

Explanation:

We've heard it said that acceptance tests help you *build the right thing*, and unit tests help you *build the thing right*.

We run the unit tests first to get feedback about whether the pieces of our solution (the _units_) are fundamentally working. Then, if they are, we can find out whether they play together to deliver the overall system behaviour that we're looking for.
