Up until now, we've been running Cucumber every time we make a change in order to follow the TDD process. When we find a change that's too specific to a particular domain model, we drop down to running the unit tests for that model and run them individually, again, following the TDD loop.

We wanted to take a moment to highlight something that's been in the codebase we're working with for a while, but that we've perhaps taken for granted.

It's here, in our `package.json` file: shot::[1]

[source,javascript]
include::../code/js/00-initial-commit/package.json[lines=6..8]

What this means, is that every time we run the command `npm test`, shot::[2] we first run our unit tests (using the javascript unit testing tool, `mocha`)shot::[3] and then, if those pass, we run our acceptance tests using Cucumber. shot::[4]

In this case, we're filtering out the scenarios tagged with `@todo` shot::[5] so we only run the ones we'd expect to pass.

Refactoring, the process of improving the design without changing the behaviour of the code, needs us to have a way to quickly check that the behaviour of the code hasn't changed.

Having this `npm test` command to lean on as we refactor is very useful, because we can use a single command to make sure everything is passing. shot::[6]
