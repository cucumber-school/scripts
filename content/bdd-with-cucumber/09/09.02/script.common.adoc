=== Layers of a Cucumber Test Suite

So where do your feature files sit on this diagram of problem and solution domains?

Well, we hope they sit right in the middle here, and act as the place where the problem and solution domains come together. Someone from either domain should be able to read a feature file and it will make sense to them.

And how about step definitions?

Step definitions are right on the boundary, here, translating between the problem-domain language we use in our Gherkin scenarios and the concrete actions we take in code to pull and poke at our solution.

We want to prevent solution-domain concepts and language from leaking into our Gherkin scenarios to keep them readable. As we saw in the last lesson, when we remove details from scenarios, we trade-off for increased complexity in our step definitions.

So how do we manage this complexity?

A mature Cucumber test suite will have a layer of support code sitting between the step definitions and the system being automated.

This layer of support code literally supports the step definitions by providing an API for automating your application.

We can extract this API from our step definitions. Letâ€™s pick up the shouty codebase from Chapter 8 and show you what we mean.
