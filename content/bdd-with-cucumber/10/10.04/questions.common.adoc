==== Lesson 4 - Questions

===== Why did we add a test for mentioning the word `buy` many times if we already had that tested on our scenarios?

* Because we don't really trust our scenarios
* Because we want to have insurance at the unit test level that everything is workin as we expect (*Correct*)

===== Why did we remove the bug reference from our scenario?

* It's now outdated, since the bug has been fixed (*Correct*)

===== Was it OK to remove the `@todo` tag from scenario once we fixed the bug?

* No, we should have left it in, since we want that specific test to be ignored when we run the full test suite
* Yes, since it's not something we need to fix any more (*Correct*)
* Yes, since we're not using the `@todo` tag anymore in our project

===== Why did we run just unit tests at first and  later the whole suite once we fixed the bug?

* Because we wanted to make sure that the fix was working with a fast suite test first (*Correct*)
* Because we like Ice-Cones
* Because Cucumber won't run unless we run the unit tests before
