=== TDD our fix with a unit test

* Add a test for multiple "buy" mentions in one shout. Watch it fail.
* Fix the bug
* Remove @todo tag and BUG reference.
* Discuss with Paula & Tammy; Remove the scenario altogether since we have a unit test for this now.

=== Another edge case

* We spotted that the regex is case sensitive - what if the word "buy" is capitalized?
* Quick conversation with Paula - yes we should charge even if the word is capitalized. Do we need it as a scenario? No.
* Add a unit test
* Make it pass
* Done
