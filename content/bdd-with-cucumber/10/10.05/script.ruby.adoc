=== Another edge case

Let's take a look at the `deduct_credits` method.shot::[1]

[source,rb]
----
include::../code/ruby/10-remove-scenario-from-feature-file/lib/shouty.rb[lines=54..57]
----

There's something on this method that caught our attention: the regex we're using is case sensitive.shot::[2]

[source,rb]
----
include::../code/ruby/10-remove-scenario-from-feature-file/lib/shouty.rb[lines=56]
----

Which raises the question, what should happen if the word has a different capitalization?

To answer this question, we have a quick chat with Paula, who confirms that it should have the same effect as if it were lowercased: deduct 5 credits.

So lets first add a test.shot::[3]

We'll copy the same test we copied last time,shot::[4] and capitalize the word "Buy".shot::[5]

[source,rb]
----
include::../code/ruby/11-add-test-for-capitalized-buy/spec/network_spec.rb[lines=95..105]
----

Now we run the spec to watch it fail.shot::[6]

[source,sh]
----
$ rspec
Calling `DidYouMean::SPELL_CHECKERS.merge!(error_name => spell_checker)' has beeell_checker)' instead.

Now we write the code that'll make it pass.shot::[7]

[source,rb]
----
include::../code/ruby/12-make-capitalized-buy-test-pass/lib/shouty.rb[lines=56]

And finally, we run the entire test suite to watch that beautiful green.shot::[8]

$ rspec
Calling `DidYouMean::SPELL_CHECKERS.merge!(error_name => spell_checker)' has been deprecated. Please call `DidYouMean.correct_error(error_name, spell_checker)' instead.
