=== Another edge case

Let's take a look at the `deduct_credits` method. shot::[1]

[source,java]
----
include::../code/java/10-remove-scenario-from-feature-file/shouty/src/main/java/shouty/Network.java[lines=33..43]
----

There's something on this method that caught our attention: the regex we're using is case sensitive.shot::[2]

[source,java]
----
include::../code/java/10-remove-scenario-from-feature-file/shouty/src/main/java/shouty/Network.java[lines=9]
----

Which raises the question, what should happen if the word has a different capitalization?

To answer this question, we have a quick chat with Paula, who confirms that it should have the same effect as if it were lowercased: deduct 5 credits.

So lets first add a test.shot::[3]

We'll copy the same test we copied last time,shot::[4] and capitalize the word "Buy".shot::[5]

[source,java]
----
include::../code/java/11-add-test-for-capitalized-buy/shouty/src/test/java/shouty/NetworkTest.java[lines=107..118]
----

Now we run the spec to watch it fail.shot::[6]

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn test
----

Now we write the code that'll make it pass.shot::[7]

[source,java]
----
include::../code/java/12-make-capitalized-buy-test-pass/shouty/src/main/java/shouty/Network.java[lines=9]
----

And finally, we run the entire test suite to watch that beautiful green.shot::[8]

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn test
