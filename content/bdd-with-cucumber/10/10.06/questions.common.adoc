==== Lesson 6 - Questions

===== Do we need to keep a scenario AND a unit test that test the same code?

* Yes, always. This is called double-entry testing
* No! Do Not Repeat Yourself!
* We decide by talking it though with our team and assessing the pros and cons of both options (*Correct*)

Explanation:

This is really a subjective decision. Ideally we'd have as few scenarios as possible, but
because not everyone can read unit tests, we need to keep enough scenarios around for
everyone on the team to feel confident that the whole set of behaviour is being tested.

Sometimes that's a line that can change over time, as the folks on the team get comfortable
with autoamted testing, from having seen fewer bugs appearing.
