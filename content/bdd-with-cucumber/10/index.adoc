== Acceptance Tests vs Unit Tests

In the last chapter, we extracted a layer of support code from your step definitions to keep your Cucumber code easy - and cost-effective - to maintain.

We’re going to keep things technical in this chapter. Remember that bug we spotted right back at the beginning of lesson seven, where the user was over-charged if they mentioned “buy” several times in the same message? It’s finally time to knuckle down and fix it.

As we do so, you’re going to get some more experience of the inner and outer BDD loops that we first introduced you to in lesson 5. We’ll learn about mock objects, and explore the difference between unit tests and acceptance tests, and learn the value of each.

If you’re someone who doesn’t normally dive deep into code, try not to worry. We’ll keep the example from moving too fast, and we hope you’ll find it educational to see how different kinds of tests complement each other in helping you to build a quality product.
