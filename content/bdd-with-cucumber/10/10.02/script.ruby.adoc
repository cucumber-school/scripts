=== Testing ice cream cone

Now that we have tidied up the scenario, we need to find the source of our bug.

We have a passing unit test suite. shot::[1] So this doesn't give us any clues as to where the problem lies in the code.

[source,sh]
----
$ rspec
...........

Finished in 0.008 seconds (files took 0.06097 seconds to load)
11 examples, 0 failures

Since we know there's a bug, we should have at least one unit test failing. So that's an indication that we might be missing a test. Lets see how we're testing the mention of the word "buy" in the lower level tests. shot::[2, "Scroll through all the unit tests for the Network class"]

Oh my! We have absolutely no tests for this feature on our unit test suite! shot::[3] The only test here about credits is this one for charging for shouts that are over 180 characters. We'll need to remedy this in order to triage our problem.
