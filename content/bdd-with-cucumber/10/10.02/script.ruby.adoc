=== Testing ice cream cone

Now we need to find the source cause of our bug. We have a passing test suite. shot::[1]

[source,sh]
----
$ rspec
Calling `DidYouMean::SPELL_CHECKERS.merge!(error_name => spell_checker)' has been deprecated. Please call `DidYouMean.correct_error(error_name, spell_checker)' instead.

Since we know there's a bug, we should have at least one test failing. So that's an indication that we might be missing a test. Lets see how we're testing the mention of the word "buy" in the lower level tests.

Oh my! we have absolutely no tests for this feature on our unit test suite.shot::[2] We'll need to remedy this in order to triage our problem.

// Matt: I'm not sure if what I'm showing here (in the script) is enough. Maybe show all the spec descriptions ...
