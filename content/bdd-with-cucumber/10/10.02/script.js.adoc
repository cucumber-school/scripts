=== Testing ice cream cone

Now that we have tidied up the scenario, we need to find the source of our bug.

We have a passing unit test suite. shot::[1] So this doesn't give us any clues as to where the problem lies in the code.

[source,sh]

$ npx mocha


  Network
    ✓ broadcasts a message to a listener within range
    ✓ does not broadcast a message to a listener out of range
    ✓ does not broadcast a message to a listener out of range negative distance
    ✓ does not broadcast a message over 180 characters even if listener is in range
    ✓ can change the range
    credits
      ✓ deducts 2 credits for a shout over 180 characters

  Person
    ✓ subscribes to the network
    ✓ has a location
    ✓ broadcasts shouts to the network
    ✓ remembers messages heard
    ✓ can be moved to a different location

Since we know there's a bug, we should have at least one unit test failing. So that's an indication that we might be missing a test. Lets see how we're testing the mention of the word "buy" in the lower level tests.

Oh my! We have absolutely no tests for this feature on our unit test suite! shot::[3] The only test here about credits is this one for charging for shouts that are over 180 characters. We'll need to remedy this in order to triage our problem.
