=== Testing ice cream cone

Now we need to find the source cause of our bug. We have a passing test suite. shot::[1]

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn test
----

Since we know there's a bug, we should have at least one unit test failing. So that's an indication that we might be missing a test. Lets see how we're testing the mention of the word "buy" in the lower level tests. shot::[2, "Scroll through all the unit tests for the Network class"]

Oh my! We have absolutely no tests for this feature on our unit test suite! shot::[3] The only test here about credits is this one for charging for shouts that are over 180 characters. We'll need to remedy this in order to triage our problem.
