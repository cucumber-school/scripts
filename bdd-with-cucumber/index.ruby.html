<h3 id="_an_introduction_to_shouty">2.1. An introduction to Shouty</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shouty is a social network that allows people who are physically close to communicate, just like people have always communicated with their voices. In the real world you can talk to someone in the same room, or across the street. Or even 100 m away from you in a park - if you shout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s Shouty. What you say on this social network can only be “heard” by people who are nearby.</p>

<h3 id="_choose_the_first_scenario">2.2. Choose the first scenario</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s start with a very basic example of Shouty’s behaviour. Something we might have discussed in a three amigos meeting:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sean the shouter shouts "free bagels at Sean&#8217;s" and Lucy the listener who happens to be stood across the street from his store, 15 metres away, hears him. She walks into Sean’s Coffee and takes advantage of the offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We can translate this into a Gherkin scenario so that Cucumber can run it. Here&#8217;s how that would look.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="gherkin"><span class="kn">Scenario</span><span class="p">:</span> Listener is within range
  <span class="nf">Given </span>Lucy is located 15m from Sean
  <span class="nf">When </span>Sean shouts <span class="s">"free bagels at Sean's"</span>
  <span class="nf">Then </span>Lucy hears Sean’s message</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see there are four special keywords being used here. <code>Scenario</code> just tells Cucumber we’re about to describe an example that it can execute. Then you see the lines beginning with Given, When and Then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<code>Given</code> is the context for the scenario. We’re putting the system into a specific state, ready for the scenario to unfold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<code>When</code> is an action. Something that happens to the system that will cause something else to happen: an outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<code>Then</code> is the outcome. It’s the behaviour we expect from the system when this action happens in this context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll notice we’ve omitted from our outcome anything about Lucy walking into Sean’s store and making a purchase. Remember, Gherkin is supposed to describe the behaviour of the system, so it would be distracting to have it in our scenario.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each scenario has these three ingredients:

  a context,

  an action,

  and one or more outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Together, they describe one single aspect of the behaviour of the system. An example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we’ve translated our example into Gherkin, we can automate it!</p>

Gherkin is just one way of expressing examples of how you want your system to behave. The advantage of using this particular format is that you can use Cucumber to test them for you, making them into Living Documentation.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s a business goal which does not belong in a Gherkin document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As BDD practitioners, we&#8217;re focussed on the behaviour of the system, so we don&#8217;t care about the people who use the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Including details about these two people would be distracting from the main point of our scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Executable scenarios need to stay focussed on the behaviour of the system itself. We can document business goals elsewhere in our Gherkin to provide context. - TRUE</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:
Behaviour-Driven Development practitioners definitely do care about business goals, but when we&#8217;re writing the Scenario part of our Gherkin, we need to focus on the observable, testable behaviour of the system we&#8217;re building.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later in the course we&#8217;ll show you how you can use other parts of Gherkin documents to add other relevant details, like business goals, to make great executable specifications.</p>

<h3 id="_install_cucumber">2.3. Install Cucumber</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we get started make sure you have a modern version of Ruby installed,

<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>cucumber

1 scenario (1 undefined)
3 steps (3 undefined)
0m0.051s

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given("Lucy is located {int}m from Sean") do |int|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When("Sean shouts {string}") do |string|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then("Lucy hears Sean'</span>s message<span class="s2">") do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<em>Undefined</em> means Cucumber doesn’t know what to do for any of the three steps we wrote in our Gherkin scenario. It needs us to provide some <em>step definitions</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step definitions translate from the plain language you use in Gherkin into Ruby code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Cucumber runs a step, it looks for a step definition that matches the text in the Gherkin step. If it finds one, then it executes the code in the step definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it doesn’t find one… well, you’ve just seen what happens. Cucumber helpfully prints out some code snippets that we can use as a basis for new step definitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Let’s copy those to create our first step definitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p> 
We’ll paste them into a Ruby file under the <code>step_definitions</code> directory, inside the <code>features</code> directory. We&#8217;ll just call it <code>steps.rb</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time the output is a little different. None of the steps are undefined anymore. We now have a pending step  and two skipped ones. This means Cucumber found all our step definitions, and executed the first one.

<p>&lt;java&gt;
Cucumber tells us that a step (and by inference the Scenario that contains it) is Pending when the automation code throws a PendingException.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PendingException is a special type of exception provided by Cucumber to allow the development team to signal that automation for a step is a work in progress. This makes it possible to tell the difference between steps that aren&#8217;t finished yet and steps that are failing due to a defect in the system.</p>

<ul>

<p>Does the name of the method correctly describe the intent of the step? - TRUE</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:
When Cucumber/SpecFlow generates a snippet, it has no idea of the business context of the undefined step. The implementation that Cucumber/SpecFlow generates will definitely not automate what&#8217;s been written in your Gherkin - that&#8217;s up to you! Also, the name of the method and the parameters are just placeholders. It&#8217;s the job of the person writing the code to rename the method and parameters to reflect the business domain.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:
If you read the comment in the generated snippet, Cucumber/SpecFlow is telling you to "turn the phrase above into concrete actions".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need your step definition to call your application and do whatever the Gherkin step describes. In the case of our first step here, we want to tell the system that there are two people in certain locations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can use the act of fleshing out the body of our step definition as an opportunity to do some software design. We can think about what we want the interface to our system to look like, from the point of view of someone who needs to interact with it. Should we interact with it through the User Interface, or make a call to the programmer API directly? How would we like that interface to work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can do all of this without writing any implementation yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is known as "outside-in" development. It helps us to ensure that when we do come to implementing our solution, we&#8217;re implementing it based on real needs.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sketch_out_the_solution">2.5. Sketch out the solution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now that we have the step definitions matching, we can start working on our solution. We like to use our scenarios to <em>guide</em> our development, so we&#8217;ll start designing the objects we&#8217;ll need by sketching out some code in our step definitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scenario will be failing while we do this, but we should see the error messages gradually progressing as we drive out the interface to our object model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our next goal is for the scenario to fail because we need to implement the actual business logic. <em>Then</em> we can work on changing the business logic inside our objects to make it pass.</p>

<p>Explanation:
Behaviour-Driven Development comes from Test-Driven Development, where we always start with a failing test, then use that to guide our development. This sometimes described as red-green-refactor.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>red - write a scenario/test and see it fail
green - make it pass (as simply as possible)
refactor - improve your code, while keeping all the tests/scenarios green</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s surprisingly easy to write scenarios and step definitions that don&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s the transition from red to green that gives us confidence that the scenario and the implementation actually do what we expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a scenario passes as soon as we write it, that means that either it&#8217;s not doing what we think it should or the behaviour that it describes has already been implemented. In that case, we&#8217;re not developing using behaviour-driven development.</p>

<p>Explanation:
When you need to assert for a specific value coming out of your system in a Then step, you can use an instance variable to store it where it goes into the system (in a Given or When) step. This means you can avoid duplicating the value in multiple places in your code.</p>

<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous chapter we explored the fundamental components of a Cucumber test suite, and how we use Cucumber to drive out a solution, test-first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First we specified the behaviour we wanted, using a Gherkin scenario in a feature file. Then we wrote step definitions to translate the plain english from our scenario into concrete actions in code. Finally, we used the step definitions to guide us in building out our very basic domain model for the Shouty application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We tend to think of the code that actually pokes around with the system as distinct from the step definitions, so we’ve drawn an extra box labelled "automation code" for this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automation code can do almost anything to your application: it can drive a web browser around your site, make HTTP requests to a REST API, or&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as you’ve already seen&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;drive a domain model directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automation code is a big topic that we’ll come back to. First, we want to concentrate on step definitions.
Good step definitions are important because they enable the <em>readability</em> of your scenarios. The better you are at matching plain language phrases from Gherkin, the more expressive you can be when writing scenarios. Teams who do this well refer to their features as <em>living documentation</em> - a specification document that never goes out of date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Cucumber first started, we used to use <em>regular expressions</em> to match plain language phrases from Gherkin steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regular expressions have quite an intimidating reputation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we replaced them with something simpler, something we call <em>Cucumber expressions</em>. Cucumber is backwards compatible so you can still use the power of regular expressions if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter is all about Cucumber Expressions.</p>

<p>Answer: A step definition is a piece of code that is called by Cucumber in response to a step in a scenario. You can write any code you like inside a step definition, but we&#8217;ve found it easier to maintain if we keep them short.

<p>As Cucumber starts to execute this feature, it will come to the first step of the scenario <code>Given Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean</code>  and say to itself "now - do I have any step definitions that match the phrase <code>Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean</code>?”"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The most simple cucumber expression that would match that step is this one:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s pretty simple isn&#8217;t it? Cucumber expressions are just string patterns, and the most simple pattern you can use is a perfect match.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Ruby, we can use this pattern to make a step definition like this: </p>

Sometimes, we want to write step definitions that allow us to use different values in our Gherkin scenarios. For example, we might want to have other scenarios that place Lucy a different distance away from Sean. </p>

<p>To capture interesting values from our step definitions, we can use a feature of Cucumber Expressions called <em>parameters</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, to capture the number of metres, we can use the <code>{int}</code> parameter:  which is passed as an argument to our step definition: </p>

<p>Now we’re capturing that value as an argument. The value <code>100</code> will be passed to our code automatically by Cucumber.</p>

<h3 id="_flexibility">3.4. Flexibility</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it&#8217;s important to try to use consistent terminology in our Gherkin scenarios to help develop the ubiquitous language of your domain, we also want scenarios to read naturally, which sometimes means allowing a bit of flexibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, the language used in scenarios should never be constrained by your step definitions. Otherwise they&#8217;ll end up sounding like they were written by robots. Or worse, they read like code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
One common example is the problem of plurals. Suppose we want to place Lucy and Sean just 1 metre apart:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="gherkin">    <span class="nf">Given </span>Lucy is located 1 metre from Sean</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Because we’ve used the singular <code>metre</code> instead of the plural <code>metres</code> we don&#8217;t get a match:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>$ bundle exec cucumber

1 scenario (1 undefined)
3 steps (2 skipped, 1 undefined)

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given("Lucy is located {int} metre from Sean") do |int|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What a pain!</p>

<p>Fear not. We can just surround the <code>s</code> in parentheses to make it optional, like this: </p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is one way to smooth off some of the rough edges in your cucumber expressions, and allow your scenarios to be as expressive as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another is to allow <em>alternates</em> - different ways of saying the same thing. For example, to accept this step: </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="gherkin">    <span class="nf">Given </span>Lucy is standing 1 metre from Sean</code></pre>

<h3 id="_custom_parameters">3.5. Custom parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although you can get a long way with Cucumber Expressions' built-in parameter types, you get real power when you define your own <em>custom parameter types</em>. This allows you to transform the text captured from the Gherkin into any object you like before it&#8217;s passed into your step definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s define our own <code>{person}</code> custom parameter type that will convert the string <code>Lucy</code> into an instance of <code>Person</code> automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We can start with the step definition, which would look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">Given</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"{person} is located/standing {int} metre(s) from Sean"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">move_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">distance</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If we run Cucumber at this point we&#8217;ll see an error, because we haven&#8217;t defined the <code>{person}</code> parameter type yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ bundle exec cucumber
Undefined parameter type {person} (Cucumber::CucumberExpressions::UndefinedParameterTypeError)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s how we define one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p> 
Let&#8217;s create a new Ruby file in <code>features/support</code> called <code>person_parameter.rb</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">person_parameter.rb</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'shouty'</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the <code>ParameterType</code> DSL method from Cucumber to define our new parameter type. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need to give it a <code>name</code> which is the name we&#8217;ll use inside the curly brackets in our step definition expressions. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also need to define&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;gasp!&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a regular expression.  This is necessary to tell cucumber expressions what text to match when searching for this parameter in a Gherkin step. We won&#8217;t go into the details of regular expressions in this video, but in this case we&#8217;re just matching on either of the names of the people we&#8217;re using in our scenario. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s a transformer block,  which takes the text captured from the Gherkin step that matched the regular expression pattern, and runs some code. The return value of this block is what will be passed to the step definition. In this case, the block is passed the name of the person (as a string)  which we can then pass to the <code>Person</code> class&#8217;s constructor. </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">person_parameter.rb</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'shouty'</span>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous chapter, we talked about the importance of having readable scenarios, and you learned some new skills with Cucumber Expressions to help you achieve that goal. Those skills will give you the confidence to write scenarios exactly the way you want, knowing you’ll be able to match the Gherkin steps easily from your step definition code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We emphasise readability because from our experience, writing Gherkin scenarios is a software design activity. Cucumber was created to bridge the communication gap between business domain experts and development teams. When you collaborate with domain experts to describe behaviour in Gherkin, you’re expressing the group’s shared understanding of the problem you need to solve. The words you use in your scenarios can have a deep impact on the way the software is designed, as we’ll see in later chapters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more fluent you become in writing Gherkin, the more useful a tool it becomes to help you facilitate this communication. Keeping your scenarios readable means you can get feedback at any time about whether you’re building the right thing. Over time, your features become living documentation about your system. We can’t emphasize enough how important it is to see your scenarios as more than just tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maintaining a living document works both ways: the scenarios will guide your solution design, but you may also have to update your Gherkin to reflect the things you learn as you build the solution. This dance back and forth between features and solution code is an important part of BDD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we’ll learn about feature descriptions, the Background keyword, and about keeping scenarios and code up-to-date with your current understanding of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let’s catch up with what’s been happening on the Shouty project.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we start, I need to explain about a continuity error between the previous chapter and this next one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the last chapter we showed you how to use <em>parameter types</em> to automatically create an instance of our <code>Person</code> class whenever we used it in a step defintion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the first version of video series was first created many years ago, before we had added parameter types to Cucumber. Although we updated the previous chapter to demonstrate parameter types to you, we haven&#8217;t yet updated this one. So you&#8217;ll notice as you follow along here that there&#8217;s no mention of parameter types anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the things we&#8217;ll be doing to clean up the code in this chapter would be even cleaner if we used parameter types, and we hope to update this video someday to incorporate them into the story. In the meantime we&#8217;ll leave it as an exercise for you to think about how you would change the work we do in this episode to make the most of them.</p>

<p>In the step definition layer, we can see that a new class has been defined, the Network. We’re creating an instance of the network here. Then we pass that network instance to each of the Person instances we create here. So both instances of Person depend on the same instance of network. The Network is what allows people to send messages to one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also a couple of new unit test classes in the <code>spec</code> directory, one for the Network class, and another one for the Person class.</p>

<p>After the feature keyword, we have space in a Gherkin document to write any arbitrary text that we like. We call this the feature’s <em>description</em>.

<p>In this case, we can add a high level description of the Shouty application. Because Shouty doesn&#8217;t yet filter by proximity, we can also write a todo list here so it’s clear that we do intend to get to that soon.</p>

Let’s simplify this code to do just what it needs to do right now, and no more. We can start from the scenario by changing this single step to express what’s actually going on. We’ll work on one scenario at a time, and update the other one once we’re happy with this one.</p>

<p>Now the scenario names make sense, and we have two steps, each creating a person. Notice we’re starting to reveal some more of our domain language here: we’ve introduced the words <code>Person</code> and <code>name</code>. Person is already a part of our domain language, so it’s nice to have that revealed in the language of the scenario. Name may well become an attribute of our person soon, so it’s also useful to have that surfaced so we can get feedback about it from the team.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing we’ve lost by doing this is the idea that, eventually, the two people will need to be close to each other for the message to be transmitted.

In this case, as well as adding it to the TODO list above, we’ve decided to document the range rule, and write a couple of new empty scenarios to remind us to implement that behaviour later.</p>

We now have two step definitions to implement, and that presents us with a bit of a problem. We need the same instance of Network available in both. We could just assume that the Lucy step will always run first and create it there, but that seems fragile. If someone wrote a new scenario that didn’t create people in the right order, they’d end up with no Network instance, and weird bugs. We want our steps to be as independent as possible, so they can be easily composed into new scenarios.</p>

<p>Answer: A Before hook runs before each scenario. Since there is no way to tell if a hook exists by looking at the feature file, you should only use hooks for performing actions that you don&#8217;t expect the business to provide feedback on.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a good idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steps should be independent and composable. If the Network is only created when Lucy is created, future scenarios will be forced to create Lucy - TRUE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&#8217;ll need to create another Network instance when we create Sean</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Answer: Every person needs to share the <strong>same</strong> Network instance, which means we need to create the Network before we create any people. By creating the Network instance in the same step definition that we create Lucy, we are forcing people to:
* create Lucy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;even if the scenario doesn&#8217;t need Lucy
* create Lucy before any other person&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because otherwise Network will not have been created yet</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, so we’ve cleaned things up a bit, to bring the scenarios, the code and our current understanding of the problem all into sync. What’s nice to see is how well those new steps that create Lucy and Sean match the code inside the step definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When step definitions have to make a big leap to translate between our plain-language description of the domain in the Gherkin scenario, and the code, that’s usually a sign that something is wrong. We like to see step definitions that are only one or two lines long, because that usually indicates our scenarios are doing a good job of reflecting the domain model in the code, and vice-versa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One problem that we still have with these scenarios is that we’re very fixed to only being able to use these two characters, Lucy and Sean. If we want to introduce anyone else into the scenario, we’re going to be creating quite a lot of duplicate code. In fact, the two steps for creating Lucy and Sean are almost identical, apart from those instance variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a real project we wouldn’t bother about such a tiny amount of duplication at this early stage, but this isn’t a real project! Let’s play with the skills we learned in the last chapter to make a single step definition that can create Lucy or Sean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first problem we’ll need to tackle is these hard-coded instance variable names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can use a Hash to store all the people involved in the scenario.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s try replacing Lucy first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We’ll start by creating a new Hash in the before hook, like this.</p>

<p>Answer: Step definitions are a thin glue between the plain-language description in a scenario and the software that we&#8217;re building. If the business domain and the solution domain are aligned, then there should be little translation to do in the step definition.</p>

Let’s switch back to the feature to show you one more technique for improving the readability of your scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

      <span class="nf">Then </span>Lucy should hear Sean's message</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we have common context steps - the Givens - in all the scenarios in our feature, it can sometimes be useful to get those out of the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We can literally move them into the background, using a background keyword, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="gherkin">  <span class="kn">Background</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">Given </span>a person named Lucy
    <span class="nf">And </span>a person named Sean</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
As far as Cucumber is concerned, these scenarios haven’t changed. It will still create both Lucy and Sean as the first things it does when running each of these scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
But from a readability point of view, we can now see  more clearly what’s important and interesting about these two scenarios - in this case, the message being shouted.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="gherkin">  <span class="err">Rule</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">Shouts</span> <span class="err">c</span><span class="nf">an </span>be heard by other users

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice we just went straight into When steps in our scenarios. That’s absolutely fine. We still have a context for the scenario, but we’ve chosen to push it off into the background.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, it’s debatable whether we’d bother to use a Background to do this on a real project, but this at least illustrates the technique. We rarely use Backgrounds in our projects, because although they can improve readability by removing the duplication of repeated contexts, they also harm readability by requiring people to read the Background in conjunction with each Scenario.</p>

<p>To maintain trust in the BDD process, it’s important to keep your features fresh. Even when you drive the development from BDD scenarios, you’ll still learn lessons from the implementation that might need to be fed back into your Gherkin documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, we discovered that we could find a smaller slice of this story, and defer the business rule about proximity until our next iteration. Splitting stories like this is a powerful agile technique, and one that BDD can help you to master. Now we have a clean codebase and a suite of scenarios that reflects the current state of the system’s development.</p>

<li>

<p>The steps from the background are run as if they were inserted at the beginning of every scenario in the feature file - TRUE</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Answer: The background is used to reduce duplication in scenarios by moving steps that are common to all scenarios into a single location. The steps in the background are run before every scenario in the feature file.</p>
</div>

<p>There can be a maximum of one Background per feature file. A Background only affects scenarios that are in the same feature file as the Background.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backgrounds always improve readability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Readability can decrease because the reader must remember the contents of the background even when reading scenarios at the end of the feature file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintainability can decrease because the maintainer must be aware that there is a background even when adding scenarios to the end of the feature file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintainability can decrease because the maintainer must be aware of the background when moving a scenario to a different feature file</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Answer: Backgrounds were created to aid readability, by reducing duplication in the scenarios. Unfortunately, moving important information out of a scenario means that anyone reading or modifying a feature file must be fully aware that of the existence and content of a background. Since feature files typically contain several scenarios, that means holding two sections of the feature file in your mind at the same time, making a feature file harder to read or maintain.</p>

Looking at the two new scenarios - Listener is within range  &amp; Listener is out of range  - we can see that they also contain incidental details. Since their purpose is to illustrate the "Shouts should only be heard if listener is within range" rule, there&#8217;s no need to actually document the content of the shout. </p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
That&#8217;s better. We&#8217;ve removed inessential details, so that each scenario contains only the information needed to illustrate its business rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scenarios would still run green if we removed the steps that set the range of a shout  , because the range already has a default value. We&#8217;re not going to, because since those scenarios are illustrating the rule that deals with the range of a shout, it&#8217;s an essential part of context for anyone reading them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A happy side-effect is that, in order to set the range from our scenario, we’ve had to make it a configurable property of the system . So if our business stakeholders ever change their minds about the range, we won’t have to go hunting around in the code for where we’d hard-coded it.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>They made the scenario too long</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:
The first scenario exists to illustrate the rule "Listener hears a message." Since the behaviour is not affected by the range of a shout, neither the range nor the distance between the shouter and the listener is relevant. The information is therefore <em>incidental</em> and should be omitted from the scenario.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_why_do_we_need_to_know_the_names_of_people_using_shouty">Why do we need to know the names of people using Shouty?</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s important that every person in the system has a real name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s necessary to use <em>persona</em>, where the shouter is called Sean and the listeners are called Lucy or Larry</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The automation code has been written to recognise the names Sean, Lucy, and Larry</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:
It&#8217;s necessary to be able to distinguish the people that are involved in the scenario. We have called them Sean, Lucy, and Larry, but we could have called them Shouter, Listener1, and Listener2 (or even User1, User2, and User3).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We find that using <em>persona</em> (where the name gives an indication of the person&#8217;s purpose in the scenario) can be a useful way of conveying information, without cluttering up the scenario. If the names conveyed no information at all, they would not contribute to the readability of the scenario, and could be considered incidental.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:
This scenario is illustrating the rule that the "offer is only valid for Shouty users". It&#8217;s therefore essential to know that Nora is not a Shouty user, because this means that she is not eligible for the offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t need to know that Nora orders a coffee, because that has no relevance to the rule. Nor do we need to know when the offer expires, when Nora places the order, or how much she will be charged&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there will be other rules (and other scenarios) that illustrate that behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it&#8217;s incidental that the offer is for bagels, it is necessary to illustrate that Nora has ordered the item that is on offer to Shouty users&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and that she will be charged for that item. We use "bagels" as an example to make the scenario easier to read, not because there&#8217;s something inherently special about bagels!</p>

<p>Explanation:
Cucumber attempts to convert each non-header row in the data table into an instance of OrderLine by calling this method. For the conversion to succeed, the header cell text must match the hard coded index strings used in the method exactly. The order of the columns is not significant and any extra columns are ignored. A Data Table with only a header row would be considered an empty table and createOrderLine() would not be called and the relavent step definition would be passed an empty list of OrderLine objects.</p>

<p>See how natural it is to use a Data Table here? We also haven’t used any column headers in this case, since the data is all in a single column anyway.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s run Cucumber to generate the new step definition  and paste it into our step definitions file   </p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might have noticed that we’ve followed a pattern when we added behaviour to the system during this episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First we expressed the behaviour we wanted in a Gherkin scenario, wired up the step definitions, then ran Cucumber to watch it fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, we found the first class in our domain model that needed to change in order to support that new behaviour. In this case, the Network class. We used a unit test to describe how we wanted instances of that class to behave. Then we ran the unit test and watched it fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We focused in and made changes to the class until its unit tests were passing. When the unit tests were passing, we then made some minor changes to clean up the code and make it more readable. This is the basic test-driven-development cycle: red, green, clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The technical name for this last clean-up step is refactoring. Refactoring is an ugly name for an extremely valuable activity: improving the design of existing code without changing its behaviour. You can think about it like cleaning up and washing the dishes after you’ve prepared a meal: basic housekeeping. But imagine the state of your kitchen if you never made time to do the dishes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Go on, imagine it for a second.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yuck!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, that’s how many, many codebase end up. The good thing about taking this course is that we’re teaching you how to write solid automated tests, and the good thing about having solid automated tests is you can refactor with confidence, knowing that if you accidentally change the system’s behaviour, your tests will tell you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once we’re done refactoring, what do we do next? Run Cucumber, of course! In this case, our scenario was passing with a single trip round the inner TDD loop, but sometimes you can spend several hours working through all the unit tests you need to get a single scenario to green.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the acceptance test is passing, we figure out the next most valuable scenario on our todo list, and start the whole thing all over again!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Together, these two loops make the BDD cycle. The outer loop, which starts with an acceptance test, keeps us focussed on what the business needs us to do next. The inner loop, where we continuously test, implement then refactor small units of code, is where decide how we’ll implement that behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these levels of feedback are important. It’s sometimes said that your acceptance tests ensure you’re building the right thing, and your unit tests ensure you’re building the thing right.</p>

<p>Since part of the definition of refactoring is that it shouldn&#8217;t change the behaviour of the code, they will run the tests to make sure nothing was broken.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:
Once we have a scenario, we automate it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and we expect it to fail, because we haven&#8217;t added the functionality it specifies to the system yet. This is the beginning of the outer, acceptance test loop, that ensures we&#8217;re building what the Product Owner wants: "build the right thing."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then enter the inner, unit test loop. It&#8217;s unit tests that define the precise behaviour of small units of code&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and ensure that we "build the thing right." They give us the safety to improve the code&#8217;s design (refactor), because they will fail if we accidentally change the code&#8217;s behaviour while refactoring. We may have to go round the inner loop a number of times, adding several unit tests, before we&#8217;ve added enought functionality to make the outer acceptance test pass.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Hello, and welcome back to Cucumber School.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last time we learned about two very different kinds of loops. First, we used DataTables to loop over data in your scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then we learned about TDD cycles. We saw how the outer loop of TDD helps you to build the right thing while the inner loop helps you build the thing right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this lesson, we’re going to teach you all about how to configure Cucumber.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we start working on a new scenario we often take a dive down to the inner TDD loop where we use a unit testing tool to drive out new classes or modify the behaviour of existing ones. When our unit tests are green and the new code is implemented we return to the Cucumber scenarios to verify whether we have made overall progress or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we have lots of Cucumber scenarios, it can be distracting to run all of them each time we do this. We often want to focus on a single scenario - or perhaps just a couple - to get feedback on what we’re currently working on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several ways to do this in Cucumber - and your IDE may offer other options. We&#8217;ll start by showing some basic filtering on the command line, before showing you some alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably the easiest way to filter is to tell Cucumber to run only a scenario with a particular name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p> 
We can pass arguments to Cucumber using the <code>--name</code> option, which tells Cucumber to only run scenarios with a name matching "Message is too long".</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber --name "Message is too long"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The value of the <code>--name</code> option is actually a regular expression, so you can use your imagination here to run more than one scenario. Let&#8217;s use it to run all scenarios with the text "range" in their name. </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber --name "range"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can also use the abbreviated form of <code>--name</code>, <code>-n</code> </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber -n "range"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can accomplish the same thing by adding some configuration on the <code>cucumber.yml</code> file, but we&#8217;ll talk about that at the end of the lesson.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to tell Cucumber to run a specific scenario is to specify the line number of the scenario within a feature file. The 'Message too long' scenario starts on line 44 in the feature file. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can use that line number when we run Cucumber.   </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber features/hear_shout.feature:44</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can even specify multiple line numbers for each file. Let&#8217;s run 'Two shouts' as well. [</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s add that line number when we run Cucumber. </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber features/hear_shout.feature:33:44</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can list several files and lines together like this if you have a specific set of scenarios you want to run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The examples that you&#8217;ve just seen set a Ruby property on the command line. If you&#8217;re working in an IDE this is less than ideal, but fortunately there are other ways to achieve exactly the same outcome.</p>

<h3 id="_filtering_with_tags">6.2. Filtering With Tags</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In the previous lesson, we modified Cucumber&#8217;s behavior using scenario names and line numbers. In this lesson I&#8217;m going to show you how to filter scenarios using tags.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let&#8217;s delete the contents of the  <code>cucumber.yml</code> file. . We&#8217;ll leave <code>default --quiet</code> for now. We&#8217;ll explain what&#8217;s it about in a later lesson.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we run Cucumber, it will run all scenarios. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ll put a focus tag right here, above this scenario.  Tags start with an at-sign and are case sensitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, after re-creating the `cucumber.yml`file, let&#8217;s add a tag expression to the default key, which Cucumber will use to filter the scenarios run </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="yaml"><span class="na">default</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">--quiet --tags @focus</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now Cucumber will run only the scenarios tagged with focus - there should be only one&#8230;&#8203; </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yep.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s entirely up to you what you name your tags. When we’re working on a particular area of the application it is common to use a temporary tag like this - we’ll remove it before we check our code into source control.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tags can be used for other purposes as well. If you have lots of scenarios it can be time-consuming to run them all every time. For example, you can tag a few of them with @smoke and run only those before you check in code to source control. </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="yaml"><span class="na">default</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">--quiet --tags @smoke</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running just the smoke tests will give you a certain level of confidence that nothing is broken without having to run them all. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re running Cucumber on a Continuous Integration Server as well, you could run all the scenarios there, detecting any regressions you might have missed by only running the smoke tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tags give you a way to organise your scenarios that cut across feature files. You can think of them like sticky labels you might put into a book to mark interesting pages that you want to refer back to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some teams also use tags to reference external documents, for example, tickets in an issue tracker or planning tool. Let’s pretend we are using an issue tracker while working on Shouty and all the behaviour we built so far is related to the issue number 11. We could tag the whole feature file with this single line at the top.  All the scenarios within that file now inherit that tag, so if we change the tag expression in cucumber.yml ,</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="yaml"><span class="na">default</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">--quiet --tags @SHOUTY-11</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cucumber will run all the scenarios in the feature file. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use more complex tag expressions to select the scenarios you want to run. For example, you could use a tag expression to exclude all the scenarios tagged as @slow.  Then rewrite the tag expression in cucumber.yml using the <code>not</code> keyword  Now when you run Cucumber, the "@slow" scenarios won&#8217;t be run. </p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="js"><span class="k">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nx">quiet</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nx">tags</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">not @slow</span><span class="dl">"</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the need to add quotes around <code>"not @slow"</code>. If they&#8217;re not added, running <code>bundle exec cucumber</code> will result in an error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can read about how to build more complicated tag expressions on the <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#tag-expressions">Cucumber website</a> </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s one more thing to learn about tags. They can be combined with hooks, so that you can be selective about which hooks to run when. We&#8217;ll cover that in a future chapter.</p>

<p>The step is undefined, but we can quickly generate it by running Cucumber  Cucumber has generated a step definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could copy and use this step definition in our <code>steps.rb</code> file the same way we do with regular English. But let&#8217;s remove the <code>cat.feature</code> file and continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that when we run Cucumber, the scenarios run in the order that the occur in the feature file  That&#8217;s fine, but there&#8217;s a chance that since they always run in the same order we might accidentally make one scenario dependent on some other scenario.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each scenario should be isolated - it&#8217;s result should not depend on the outcome of any other scenario. To help you catch any dependencies between your scenarios, Cucumber can be told to run your scenarios in a random order.</p>

<p>To do this, we can use the random flag in the profile file. </p>

<p>Scenarios should be isolated from each other - which means that one scenario should never rely on the behaviour of any other scenario for it to behave as expected.

<h3 id="_formatter_plugins">6.4. Formatter plugins</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cucumber can report results in other formats, which can be useful for generating reports. Let’s take a closer look at some of the formatter plugins that ship with Cucumber - starting with the HTML formatter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we use the html formatter we need to specify the filename that the report should be written to using the --out flag. Otherwise it will be written directly to the console.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber --format html --out report.html</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the html that has been generated.  As you can see, this generates a nicely structured HTML page that details what scenarios were run and whether the system behaved as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Next, we&#8217;ll use the JSON formatter. We can use the abbreviated version of our <code>--format</code> and <code>--out</code> flags <code>-f</code> and <code>-o</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber -f json -o report.json</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JSON report outputs the results in a single file.  You can write your own script or program to post-process this file to generate your own report. Additionally,  many continuous integration servers understand the json format and can turn it into a nicely formatted report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is also a progress formatter, which just prints out a single character for each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber -f progress</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We can specify multiple formatters like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code>bundle exec cucumber -f html -o  report.html -f json -o report.json -f progress</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s look at what’s in that rerun.txt file.  It’s a list of the scenarios that failed! And the format looks familiar doesn’t it? It’s using the line number filtering format that we showed you earlier.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is really useful when you have a few failing scenarios and you want to re-run only ones that failed. We tell Cucumber to run only the failed scenarios by pointing it at the rerun file. </p>

Since the scenarios are written in business language, they act as documentation that everyone interested in the product can understand. And, because the results are colour-coded green (if the system behaves as expected) or red (if it doesn&#8217;t) everyone can see what behaviour has been implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The challenge is making sure that this documentation is easily available. Feature files are usually checked into source control along with the source code, which isn&#8217;t a great way of making it accessible to less technical team members. The HTML output can be shared, but it needs to be stored somewhere that everyone has access to - such as on your intranet or wiki. That&#8217;s something that your team has to configure themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Cucumber 6.0.0 there has been a new feature that allows you to automatically publish the results online to a free service called Cucumber Reports. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ensure that you&#8217;re using Cucumber 6.0.0 or later </p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can run Cucumber again and we get a different banner output . The unique URL in this banner is the address of your published report .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Open the URL and you&#8217;ll find your report published in the same format as the HTML plugin. Now you can share the report just by sharing the URL. You also get some extra information about the run that generated the report. If you publish reports from a recognised CI server, then extra information is gathered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might have noticed the warning in the banner that says the report will "self-destruct".  To prevent a report from being deleted, it has to be associated with an authenticated account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Follow the link in the report to authenticate your account  You can then retrieve your Cucumber Reports publish token . Reports associated with a publish token will be kept until explicitly deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
During development you probably won&#8217;t want to publish a report after every build&#8230;&#8203; and you might prefer not to see the banner output telling you about Cucumber Reports. Let&#8217;s fix this in cucumber.js by replacing --publish with --publish-quiet:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now when we run Cucumber, no report is published and no banner advertising Cucumber Reports is output.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cucumber Reports is under active development, so expect to see many more useful features coming in the coming months.</p>

<p>The output from running Cucumber forms the basis of a system&#8217;s "living documentation". There are lots of tools that let you do publish and share this living documentation, but they require effort to set up and configure. Now it&#8217;s as simple as asking Cucumber to publish it.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the last lesson we took a break from the code to sharpen up your skills with Cucumber’s command-line interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now it’s time to dive right back into the code. We’re going to explore one of the hottest topics that teams come across when they start to get to grips with Cucumber and BDD: how much detail to use in your scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teams find they can’t easily agree on this. It can often seem like a matter of personal preference. It’s true there are no right and wrong answers, but we’re going to teach you some heuristics you can apply to help you make better decisions.</p>

<h3 id="_premium_accounts_with_a_bug">7.1. Premium Accounts! With a bug!</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once again, while we were away, the developers of Shouty have been busy. A new hot-shot ninja rock-star subcontractor, Stevie, has built a new feature called <em>premium accounts</em>. We don’t know much about it yet but, our tester Tamsin has reported a bug from their manual exploratory testing, and it’s up to us tofix it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_bug">7.1.1. The bug</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tamsin has helpfully documented the bug as a failing scenario. Here is it:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

Feature: Premium accounts

  @todo
  Scenario: BUG #2789
    Given Sean has bought 30 credits
    When Sean shouts "buy, buy buy!"
    Then Sean should have 25 credits
      Expected: 25
          Got: 15</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hum. So let’s try and figure out what this is all about. Sean starts out with some credits,

presumably that&#8217;s what gives his account premium status?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result of that shout, he’s obviously supposed to have some credits deducted. Tamsin’s scenario says that the correct behaviour is for 5 credits to be deducted, leaving him with 25 credits. As we can see from running the test, the system is deducting 15 credits instead.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from Tamsin’s new bug report scenario at the bottom, there’s only one scenario, and it’s long! I think I can count twelve steps altogether, excluding the background steps. As a general guideline, we like our scenarios to be no longer than about five steps long, so this is big.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The scenario has several <code>When</code> steps - nine of them in all! - which is often a sign that the scenario is trying to test more than one business rule at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We normally like to document the business rules in the Gherkin, and add a few paragraphs of prose description, but there&#8217;s no <code>Rule</code> keyword and the description section is blank, so we haven’t been left any clues there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s see if we can gleam the rules from reading the scenario carefully. Sean starts out with 30  credits and ends up with 11, but why?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s so much detail here. I wonder which bits are important. Could it be the number of words Sean shouts that affects his credits? Or the number of messages? Based on Tamsin’s test case, maybe the word “buy” is important&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s really hard to tell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s interesting that Lucy hears all Sean’s messages - even these ones which look to be over 180 characters and would normally be blocked. Perhaps premium accounts get to send messages over 180 characters in exchange for credits?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a classic example of a scenario written by someone who is using Cucumber as a <em>testing</em> tool rather than a <em>documentation</em> tool. This scenario may well work as an effective test, but it&#8217;s terrible documentation. We have no clear idea from reading it what the system is supposed to do.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seems like a good time to ask our domain experts for clarification about this behaviour. Ideally a three amigos meeting would have done this already, but things don’t always go according to the script. Let’s pay a visit to our product owner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paula the product owner tells us the rules are as follows:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, well that helps us a great deal, but this scenario is still doing a poor job of illustrating those rules. Let’s take a moment to understand why.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s all about the details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you’re first exploring a new domain problem, details like the exact messages people have shouted are a great way to shine light into the dark corners of your ignorance. They bring examples to life by making them vivid and real. This encourages what we call <em>divergent thinking</em>, which helps you discover even more examples as you explore the behaviour you need to provide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In BDD, we call this <em>deliberate discovery</em>, when we try to explore the problem domain as thoroughly as we can. Details are good here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point, however, we need to write a computer program. When that time comes, we need to switch to <em>convergent thinking</em> and try to distill down all that detail into something that clearly communicates the essence of the behaviour. Now, too much detail can be distracting, or even misleading to our future readers. We call these <em>incidental details</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being able to distill down the essence of a scenario with too much detail is a skill you&#8217;ll find yourself practicing time and time again as a BDD practitioner, since we almost always deliberately start with too much detail, then want to refine it afterwards as it becomes more clear which details are relevant, and which are incidental.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we had the <code>Rule</code> keyword in Gherkin, we always used to recommend to teams to write their rules down at the top of the feature file. This works great, but using the <code>Rule</code> keyword to make an explicit link between each scenario and the rule it illustrates is even better. As soon as we&#8217;ve broken this scenario down into smaller ones that only illustrate one rule, we can do that.</p>

<p>Using real details in your scenario can help with divergent thinking (<strong>Correct</strong>)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finding the right level of detail, and discerning which details are incidential to your scenario is a difficult, subjective process. The key thing to do is keep trying.

<h3 id="_keeping_your_scenarios_brief">7.3. Keeping your scenarios BRIEF</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seb Rose came up with a brilliant acronym to help you remember six heuristics or guidelines to think about when reviewing the quality of your scenarios: BRIEF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"B" is for <strong>Business language:</strong> The words used in a scenario should be drawn from the business domain, otherwise you will not be able to engage your business colleagues painlessly. The language you use should use terms that business team members understand unambiguously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"R" is for <strong>Real data:</strong> When you&#8217;re first discussing the details of a story, your examples should use concrete, real data. This helps bring the scenarios to life, and expose boundary conditions and underlying assumptions early in the development process. When writing scenarios, we should also use real data whenever this helps reveal intention and make them move vivid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I" is for <strong>Intention revealing:</strong> Scenarios should describe the intent of what the actors in the scenario are trying to achieve, rather than describing the mechanics of how they will achieve it. We should start by giving the scenario an intention revealing name, and then follow through by ensuring that every line in the scenario describes intent, not mechanics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"E" is for <strong>Essential:</strong> The purpose of a scenario is to illustrate how a rule should behave. Any parts of a scenario that don&#8217;t directly contribute to this purpose are <em>incidental</em> and should be removed. If they are important to the system, then they will be covered in other scenarios that illustrate other rules. Additionally, any scenarios that do not add to the reader&#8217;s understanding of the expected behaviour have no place in the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"F" is for <strong>Focused:</strong> Most scenarios should be focused on illustrating a single rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might have noticed we said "six heuristics" but we only gave you five. That&#8217;s because the word <em>Brief</em> itself is the sixth guideline. We suggest you try to restrict most of your scenarios to five lines or fewer. This makes them easier to read, much easier to reason about, and helps avoid that temptation to test multiple rules, or add incidental details.</p>

<h5 id="_b_is_for_business_language">B is for Business Language</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, does this scenario use business language?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, we can see words like "credits" and "shout" and "message" which look like terms from our problem domain&#8217;s <em>ubiquitous language</em>, but there are also a lot of words in these scenarios that are nothing to do with our domain - words like "cakes" or "chickens" or "muffins" for example. Granted, all these words are surrounded by quotes, but they&#8217;re still distracting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_r_is_for_real_data">R is for Real Data</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do these scenarios use real data? Without seeing the user research, it looks like they do. We&#8217;re not talking about "User A" or "A message", but instead we&#8217;re using realistic examples of the kinds of messages genuine users of our app might send to each other.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_i_is_for_intention_revealing">I is for Intention Revealing</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This one really hits the nail on the head. The intention of this scenario is completely obscured by all the detail. As we said earlier, we have no idea from this Gherkin what is special about these messages, or how they contribute to the final tally of expected credits. We had to go down into the code to start to figure that out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_e_is_for_essential">E is for Essential</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know whether every step here is essential to the purpose of this scenario, because we don&#8217;t even know what it&#8217;s purpose is yet! Once we&#8217;ve made the steps more intention revealing it will be easier to see if they&#8217;re all essential.</p>

<p>"E" is for <strong>Essential:</strong> The purpose of a scenario is to illustrate how a rule should behave. Any parts of a scenario that don&#8217;t directly contribute to this purpose are <em>incidental</em> and should be removed. If they are important to the system, then they will be covered in other scenarios that illustrate other rules. Additionally, any scenarios that do not add to the reader&#8217;s understanding of the expected behaviour have no place in the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The step about creating a publisher is incedental as the publisher does not appear anywhere else in the scenario. Perhaps the team added it because there&#8217;s a database relationship between books and publishers, and you can&#8217;t create a book without a publisher. That&#8217;s not a good reason to clutter up your scenario. Instead, you can use patterns like "test data builder" to create your Publisher automatically when you create a Book.</p>
</div>

<p>The step about having books on load is incidental because the number of books on loan, as far as we can tell, has no bearing on the behaviour of the search, which is what this scenario is focussed on.</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BDD is an extension of TDD, or Test-Driven Development. In both these practices, we gradually add new behaviour, with each test demanding a little more behaviour from the system. Working like this, it makes sense to work in small increments, adding focussed scenarios so that we can iterate rapidly and keep a good flow going.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pleasant side-effect of working this way is that each test has a single purpose, and so has fewer reasons to fail. So when a regression occurs, you tend to get a clear signal from the failing scenario about what&#8217;s broken. Compare this with having a single huge scenario that covers a lot of behaviour. When that fails, you know something&#8217;s wrong but you don&#8217;t have much idea about where to go to start fixing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re concious of the relationship between rules and example, and you want to make sure all of your rules are covered, it&#8217;s much easier to do that and see clearly where you might have gaps if each of your examples covers a single rule.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right. With the incidental details removed from these steps, it’s starting to become easier to see what’s going on. It would be even easier if we re-ordered them so they&#8217;re grouped together. Let’s do that:</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<div class="listingblock">

<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="gherkin">  <span class="kn">Scenario</span><span class="p">:</span> Test premium account features

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now we can clearly see that Sean shouts three regular messages, a long message, two over-long messages, and three messages containing the word “buy”. It’s still a lot to digest, but a clearer picture is starting to emerge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Are there any other incidental details remaining in this scenario? In BRIEF terms, is every step here <em>essential</em> to the purpose of this particular scenario?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Arguably, the steps that create regular and long messages are incidental, since they have no bearing on the behaviour we’re describing with this scenario. We can remove them altogether, and the behaviour should be exactly the same. So let’s do that:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="gherkin">  <span class="kn">Scenario</span><span class="p">:</span> Test premium account features

    <span class="nf">And </span>Sean should have 11 credits</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we’ve removed all that incidental detail, it’s much easier to see how the figure of 11 credits has been calculated: two over-long messages at 2 credits per message, and three messages containing the word “buy” at 5 credits each makes a total of 19 credits, which subtracted from the initial 30 makes 11.</p>

<p>A great benefit of automated tests is that you can run them while you&#8217;re refactoring to ensure you haven&#8217;t made a mistake. The definition of refactoring is that you&#8217;re improving the maintainability without changing the behaviour. This applies to your test code too, and the best way to check the behaviour hasn&#8217;t changed is to run the automated tests and check they&#8217;re all still passing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When refining your scenarios like this, there is a trade-off that you need to add a little bit more complexity to your step definition code. This is why it&#8217;s important to have software engineers working on Cucumber tests, because they&#8217;ll be confident that they can do this. When Cucumber automation is left to people with less development experience, they may be afraid of pushing additional complexity into the step defintion code, and end up leaving some really ugly scenarios.</p>

<p>Now things are really getting clearer.</p>
</div>

<p>There are still a couple of problems with this scenario. One is the name of the scenario. It really doesn’t tell us anything at all.</p>

<p>A great way to name your scenarios is to think about how they named episodes of the TV sitcom series, <em>Friends</em>. Remember? They were all called something like <em>The one where Ross is fine</em> or <em>The one where Phoebe gets married</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of expressing the outcome, we find it&#8217;s best to keep that out of our scenario, and just descrbe the context and the action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So if this scenario were an epside of Friends, what would it be called? This is the one where… well.. <em>the one where Sean shouts some over-long messages and some containing the word “buy”.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8230;&#8203;and that’s the second problem.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s trying to test both business rules at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_split_scenario">7.5.1. Split scenario</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally you’ll want at least one scenario for each business rule. That way, each scenario clearly illustrates the effect of that rule on the system. Sometimes it’s interesting to also document the effect that multiple rules have when they play out at the same time, but as you’ve already experienced, that can quickly get confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll often need more than one scenario to illustrate each rule, but in this case, one scenario for each rule looks like it will be fine for the time being.

<p>Tamsin chimes in and says she has a concern that the rules might conflict with each other in the code somehow. That&#8217;s why she likes having a scenario that covers both. As we talk about it, we realise that while we don’t need this one anymore

there’s a missing scenario - where both rules apply to the <em>same message</em>: <em>The one where there’s a shout that’s both over-long and with the word “buy” in it.</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well that’s been quite a session. We came in to fix one bug, and ended up having to fix our feature file first. We’re still not done with that, either. By pushing the incidental details down out of the scenario into the step definitions, we’ve made a mess of duplication in the step definitions. There’s a neat fix for that, but we’ll have to save that for next time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s reflect on what we’ve learned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When scenarios are very heavy in detail, they can be confusing to read. We call these <em>incidental details</em> when they are just noise that detracts from communicating the essence of the scenario.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenarios that are heavy in detail are sometimes said to be written in an <em>imperative</em> style. They contain lots of “how”, and not much “what”. We often use this style when we’re working on a brand new domain problem and are still grasping for an understanding. We just want to write <em>something</em> down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As your confidence in your domain knowledge improves, you’d expect to feel comfortable removing some of these details. Scenarios with more abstract steps like this are said to be written in a <em>declarative</em> style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a more declarative style might mean you’ll need to find names for things, like the way we had to name an over-long message. This discovery of your ubiquitous domain language is a great side-effect of distilling the essence of your scenarios. Now you have a bigger vocabulary that you can use all the way down through your code, and in your future conversations, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One down-side, as you’ve seen, of pushing the “how” down from your scenarios into the step definitions is that the step definition code becomes more complex. Some teams reject this, and prefer to use a simple vocabulary of step definitions, leaving more detail in their scenarios. There are no right and wrong answers here, but if you have sufficient competence with code, you’ll easily be able to handle that extra bit of complexity and keep readability top of your priorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s what we’ll work on next time. Bye for now!</p>

But, as we pushed the details out of our scenarios, we made the step definition code more complicated. We promised to show you how to deal with that extra complexity, and we&#8217;re going to get to that in the next chapter, Chapter 9.</p>

In terms of the three practices we introduced in Chapter 1 - Discovery, Formulation and Automation - what went wrong with the Premium Accounts feature?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking about it, we can see that the development team

jumped straight into <em>Automation</em> - writing the implementation of the feature. They did the bare minimum of

<em>Formulation</em> - just enough to automate a test for the feature, but really we did a lot of the Formulation later on as we cleaned it up. Finally, much of the

<em>Discovery</em> happened at the end once Tamsin had a chance to test the feature by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
So in essence, they did everything backwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In software projects, it’s often the unknown unknowns that can make the biggest difference between success and failure. In BDD, we always try to assume we’re ignorant of some important information and try to <em>deliberately discover</em> those unknown unknowns as early as possible, so they don’t surprise us later on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A team that invests just a little bit extra in Discovery, before they write any code, saves themselves a huge amount of wasted time further down the line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In lesson 1, we showed you an example of the <em>Three Amigos</em> - Tester, Developer and Product owner - having a conversation about a new user story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nobody likes long meetings, so we’ve developed a simple framework for this conversation that keeps it quick and effective. We call this

<em>Example Mapping</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Example Mapping session takes a single User Story as input, and aims to produce four outputs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Business Rules,

that must be satisified for the story to be implemented correctly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples

of those business rules playing out in real-world scenarios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Questions or Assumptions

that the group of people in the conversation need to deal with soon, but cannot resolve during the immediate conversation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New User Stories

sliced out from the one being discussed in order to simplify it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We capture these, as we talk, using index cards, or another virtual equivalent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working with these simple artefacts rather than trying to go straight to formulating Gherkin, allows us to keep the conversation at the right level - seeing the whole picture of the user story without getting lost in details.</p>

<h3 id="_example_mapping_how">8.2. Example Mapping: How?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first developed example mapping in face-to-face meeting using a simple a multi-colour pack of index cards and some pens. For teams that are working remotely, there are many virtual equivalents of that nowadays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the four different coloured cards to represent the four main kinds of information that arise in the conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can start with the easy stuff: Take a yellow card and write down the name of the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, do we already know any rules or acceptance criteria about this story?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Write each rule down on a blue card:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They look pretty straightforward, but let’s explore them a bit by coming up with some examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Darren the developer comes up with a simple scenario to check he understands the basics of the “buy” rule: "I start with 10 credits, I shout <em>buy my muffins</em> and then <em>I want to buy some socks</em>, then I have zero credits. Correct?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Yes", says Paula.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Darren writes this example up on a green card, and places it underneath the rule that it illustrates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Tammy the tester chimes in: "How about the one where you shout a word that contains <em>buy</em>, like <em>buyer</em> for example?

If you were to shout <em>I need a buyer for my house</em>. Would that lose credits too?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Paula thinks about it for a minute, and

decides that no, only the whole word <em>buy</em> counts. They’ve discovered a new rule!

They write that up on the rule card, and place the example card underneath it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Darren asks: "How do the users get these credits? Are we building that functionality as part of this story too?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Paula tells him that’s part of another story, and they can assume the user can already purchase credits. They write that down as a rule too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This isn’t a behaviour rule - it’s a rule about the scope of the story. It’s still useful to write it down since we’ve agreed on it. But it won’t need any examples. We could also have chosen to use a red card her to write down our assumption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Still focussed on the “buy” rule, Tammy asks: "What if they run out of credit? Say you start with 10 credits and shout <em>buy</em> three times. What’s the outcome?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paula looks puzzled. "I don’t know". She says. I’ll need to give that some thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Darren takes a red card and writes this up as a question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
They apply the same technique to the other rule about long messages, and pretty soon the table is covered in cards, reflecting the rules, examples and questions that have come up in their conversation. Now they have a picture in front of them that reflects back what they know, and still don’t know, about this story.</p>

<p>When an example map is wide like this, with a lot of different rules, it&#8217;s often a signal that there&#8217;s an opportunity to slice the story up by de-scoping some of those rules from the first iteration. Even if it&#8217;s not something that would be high enough quality to ship to a customer, you can often defer some of the rules into another story that you can implement later.</p>

<h3 id="_example_mapping_conclusions">8.3. Example Mapping: Conclusions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you’ve just seen, an example mapping session should go right across the breadth of the story, trying to get a complete picture of the behaviour. Inviting all three amigos - product owner, tester and developer - is important because each perspective adds something to the conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the apparent purpose of an example mapping session is to take a user story, and try to produce rules and examples that illustrate the behaviour, the underlying goal is to achieve a

 <em>shared understanding</em> and agreement about the precise scope of a user story. Some people tell us that example mapping has helped to build empathy within their team!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this goal in mind, make sure the session isn’t just a rubber-stamping exercise, where one person does all the talking. Notice how in our example, everyone in the group was asking questions and writing new cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the conversation, we often end up

refining, or even slicing out new user stories

to make the current one smaller.  Deciding what a story is not - and maximising the amount of work not done - is one of the most useful things you can do in a three amigos session. Small stories are the secret of a successful agile team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each time you come up with an example, try to understand what the underlying rule or rules are. If you discover an example that doesn’t fit your rules, you’ll need to reconsider your rules. In this way, the scope of the story is refined by the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although there’s no doubt of the power of examples for exploring and talking through requirements, it’s the rules that will go into the code. If you understand the rules, you’ll be able to build an elegant solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
As Dr David West says in his excellent book "Object Thinking", <em>If you problem the solution well enough, the solution will take care of itself</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, you’ll come across questions that nobody can answer. Instead of getting stuck trying to come up with an answer, just write down the question.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations! You’ve just turned an unknown unknown into a known unknown. That’s progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people think they need to produce formal Gherkin scenarios from their three amigos conversations, but in our experience that’s only occasionally necessary. In fact, it can often slow the discussion down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point of an example mapping session is to do the <em>discovery</em> work. You can do <em>formulation</em> as a separate activity, next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One last tip is to run your example mapping sessions in a timebox. When you’re practiced at it, you should be able to analyse a story within 25 minutes. If you can’t, it’s either too big, or you don’t understand it well enough yet. Either way, it’s not ready to play.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the 25 minutes, you can check whether everyone thinks the story is ready to start work on. If lots of questions remain, it would be risky to start work, but people might be comfortable taking on a story with only a few minor questions to clear up. Check this with a quick thumb-vote.</p>

<h3 id="_problem_and_solution_domains">9.1. Problem and Solution Domains</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we build software, we’re always working across two domains.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s the problem domain, where our customers and business stakeholders live, and there’s a solution domain, where we solve those business problems using technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each domain has its own jargon, it’s own dialect. That’s fine: specialized language helps domain experts to communicate. Often though, this jargon can prevent us from understanding one another across the two domains.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As BDD practitioners, we’re focussed on trying to grow this area in the middle, where we have a common or ubiquitous language. We know that the bigger this shared vocabulary is, the quicker the team can communicate ideas between the business and technology-facing sides of the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve also heard it said that if you model the problem well enough, the solution will take care of itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certainly, we believe that the better an understanding you have of the problem domain, the better a solution you can build. That’s why Cucumber is so powerful, because it helps you to stay rooted in the problem domain.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term 'ubuquitous language' comes from Eric Evans' brilliant book, Domain Driven Design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a consulting who worked on multiple projects, Eric noticed that a common factor between the projects that went well, was that <strong>people used the same words for stuff</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So if the business people referred to "Blood pressure" in their conversations, the database table where we stored records of those measurements would also be called <code>BloodPressure</code> and not something that the engineers made up, like <code>tbl_user_metric_items</code></p>

<h3 id="_layers_of_a_cucumber_test_suite">9.2. Layers of a Cucumber Test Suite</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So where do your feature files sit on this diagram of problem and solution domains?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, we hope they sit right in the middle here, and act as the place where the problem and solution domains come together. Someone from either domain should be able to read a feature file and it will make sense to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And how about step definitions?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step definitions are right on the boundary, here, translating between the problem-domain language we use in our Gherkin scenarios and the concrete actions we take in code to pull and poke at our solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We want to prevent solution-domain concepts and language from leaking into our Gherkin scenarios to keep them readable. As we saw in the last lesson, when we remove details from scenarios, we trade-off for increased complexity in our step definitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how do we manage this complexity?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A mature Cucumber test suite will have a layer of support code sitting between the step definitions and the system being automated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This layer of support code literally supports the step definitions by providing an API for automating your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can extract this API from our step definitions. Let’s pick up the shouty codebase from Chapter 8 and show you what we mean.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be hard, because we have to really learn the way our users and customers talk about their problems. But in the end that&#8217;s one of the most beneficial things you can do for your project.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve heard it said that acceptance tests help you build the right thing, and unit tests help you build the thing right.

<p>Acceptance tests are always faster so we leave them until the end</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanation:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve heard it said that acceptance tests help you build the right thing, and unit tests help you build the thing right. We run the unit tests first to get feedback about whether the pieces of our solution (the <em>units</em>) are fundamentally working. Then, if they are, we can find out whether they play together to deliver the overall system behaviour that we&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<h3 id="_close">9.5. Close</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could continue to move code from our step definitions into the support code like this. For example, we could write a support method for generating messages of a certain length.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, each step definition should only contain one or two lines that delegate to your support code. When you follow this principle, your step definitions become a translation layer from plain language into code. By keeping the vocabulary consistent as you move across the problem-solution boundary, you start to allow the scenarios to drive the design of your domain model. This is what we call modelling by example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this way, we create our own API for automating our application. As this API grows, it becomes easier and easier to write new step definitions, because the actions you need to take are already defined on the API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It might seem like over-engineering on our little Shouty application, but you’ll be surprised out quickly these test suites grow. Taking time to stamp out complexity early  and organise your code to create a good support API is a great investment for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a future lesson we’ll show you how a well-crafted automation API lets you plug your scenarios into the system at different levels, such as a web front-end.</p>

<h2 id="_acceptance_tests_vs_unit_tests">10. Acceptance Tests vs Unit Tests</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the last chapter, we extracted a layer of support code from your step definitions to keep your Cucumber code easy - and cost-effective - to maintain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’re going to keep things technical in this chapter. Remember that bug we spotted right back at the beginning of lesson seven, where the user was over-charged if they mentioned “buy” several times in the same message? It’s finally time to knuckle down and fix it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we do so, you’re going to get some more experience of the inner and outer BDD loops that we first introduced you to in lesson 5. We’ll learn about mock objects, and explore the difference between unit tests and acceptance tests, and learn the value of each.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re someone who doesn’t normally dive deep into code, try not to worry. We’ll keep the example from moving too fast, and we hope you’ll find it educational to see how different kinds of tests complement each other in helping you to build a quality product.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tidy_up_the_bug_report_gherkin">10.1. Tidy up the bug report Gherkin</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s work outside-in and start by tidying up the Gherkin specification. Right now, the scenario is still in the raw form it was in when the bug was first reported, with a name that references an ID in our bug tracking system. This doesn’t make for very good documentation about the intended behaviour.
Using our Friends Episode naming convention that we introduced in lesson 7, we can come up with a more expressive name for this scenario.
How about: the one where Sean mentions “buy” several times in the same shout?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might be worried about losing this bug ID. We could keep it in a comment, a tag, or in the description of the Scenario if we wanted to. If your team likes to keep track of such things, feel free to do that. We’d prefer to consign the bug to history - what matters to us is how the software behaves today, not how it got to be that way.
We think the values in the example could be changed to make it a little more expressive. If we start Sean off with 100 credits, and end him with 95, it more clearly illustrates the rule that only five credits should be deducted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Talking of which, let’s also update the rule to make it explicit that you lose 5 credits per shout.
RED: Improve failing scenario content and related rule</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_hunt_for_the_bug">10.2. Hunt for the bug</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good. Now let’s run our improved scenario, using the @todo tag, and go hunting for that bug:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, well we can see our scenario failing, but where do we need to go to fix it?
Luckily, our system is pretty small, and we remember that all the premium account behaviour is implemented in the Network class, so let’s go and look there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, that broadcast method is pretty complex, but I suppose the bug must be in there somewhere. Let’s try to pin it down with a unit test.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh dear, oh dear: This file does not contain any tests for the premium account behaviour!
It looks like when that so-called hot-shot ninja rockstar subcontractor, Stevie, hacked in the first version of premium accounts, he drove everything from that one great big Cucumber scenario, and never wrote any unit tests.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_value_of_unit_tests">10.3. The value of unit tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is this a problem?
Think about each automated test you write as warning light that you’re fitting to your system. Acceptance tests are warning lights that make sense to business people: when they fail, they tell you what functionality a user will not be able to enjoy because of the bug.
What a unit test does is give the programmers an indication about why the bug has occurred. Ideally, whenever you see an acceptance test’s warning light flash, there should be at least one corresponding unit test flashing too, pointing the developers to the source of the problem.
If you don’t have any unit tests, you’re left guessing where the problem lies. In a big system, this can be a serious waste of time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_retrofit_unit_tests_for_existing_behaviour">10.4. Retrofit unit tests for existing behaviour</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the responsible thing to do at this point is to retrofit some unit tests for the Network class.  We’ll start with its existing behaviour, then go on to test-drive the behaviour we need to fix our bug.
Let’s write a test case for deducting five credits when the word “buy” is mentioned once.
All our existing tests use a test double or mock object to represent the instances of Person that the Network collaborates with. So let’s go with that and try to do the same here.
First we need a mock object to represent Sean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And we’ll need to broadcast a message containing the word “buy”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What next?
Well we need to assert that Sean is told to reduce his credits. In the deduct_credits method here, we’re calling the credits setter, setting it to five less than the current value. So we need to stub the attribute getter with, say 100 credits, and then check that the setter is called with 95.
Here’s how we do that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RED: Add missing unit test for credit deductions by Network
&lt;java&gt;
This test is a real pain to write
&lt;/java&gt;
&lt;ruby&gt;
This test is a real pain to write, and we’re still not done!
Now it’s failing with this error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the stack trace, it looks like the problem is that our list of listeners hasn’t been initialised. The Network class has been built with the assumption that there’s always going to be at least one listener subscribed.
So even though it’s not relevant to our test, we’ll need to create a Lucy, and subscribe her to the Network. She’ll also need to be ready to receive a call to hear when the message is broadcast.
Fix spec
&lt;/ruby&gt;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_purpose_of_mock_objects">10.5. The purpose of mock objects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Phew. Our test is passing at last. That was hard work, and what we’ve produced is just awful.
This ugly test is typical of what happens when you use mock objects or test doubles to retro-fit tests to existing code.
So why use mocks?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mock objects are a design tool. They’re intended to be used when constructing new code, to throw together a lightweight sketch of a collaborating object. When you’re focused on building a Network, and you think it needs to collaborate with a Person, it would slow you down to have to stop and go off to build the actual Person class. It’s often quicker to use a mock object to hash out your idea of roughly what Person might look like, leaving you to stay focused on the task at hand.
As you do this, you’ll find yourself - as we just did - having to specify how you want the two objects to interact. If you think about it, this interaction - the way they talk to each other at runtime - is the true behaviour of these objects.
Remember back in lesson 5, Loops, where we explained that acceptance tests help you build the right thing, and unit tests help you build the thing right? In other words, acceptance tests help us to explore the problem domain, and unit tests help us to explore the solution.
When you drive your development from tests, the unit tests can give you feedback about the design of your solution. If it’s easy to take an individual object and plug it into your tests, your design is likely to be nicely modular, which means it will be easier to change in the future. If it’s awkward, that’s a signal there’s a problem with your design.
We call this listening to the tests.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_listening_to_the_tests">10.6. Listening to the tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One alternative to using mocks would be to use a real instance of Person instead of the mock object.
&lt;ruby&gt;
Alternate approach: Add missing unit test for credit deductions by Network - [show that integration test and then revert back to previous one]
This has a couple of apparent advantages. First, Person automatically subscribes to the Network as it is constructed, so we wouldn’t need this clutter about Lucy. Also, because we’re testing Person and Network as one integrated lump, we don’t have to fuss about exactly how they communicate about Sean’s credits. All we have to do is check how many credits he has left over at the end.
&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;java&gt;
This is very tempting. By testing Person and Network as one integrated lump, we don’t have to fuss about exactly how they communicate about Sean’s credits. All we have to do is check how many credits he has left over at the end.
&lt;/java&gt;
But this seductive solution papers over the cracks in our design.
When you use mocks, you put the microscope on the interaction between an object and its collaborators. This gives you  feedback about how coupled those objects are. A lot of chatter going back and forth like this suggests they’re getting tangled up together.
So the fact that it’s awkward to use mocks here is not because mocks are bad, or because we’re bad at using mocks: it’s feedback from the code.
Let’s listen to the tests and try to respond to this pain instead of ignoring it.
&lt;ruby&gt;</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_when_nobody_is_listening">10.7. When nobody is listening</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ll start with something easy and deal with the situation where the Network is asked to broadcast when it has no listeners. This is an annoying detail about how this object behaves that didn’t show itself in our acceptance tests. Let’s test-drive a fix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Isolate a small deficiency in Network&#8217;s contract.

<h3 id="_organising_the_tests_by_responsibility">10.8. Organising the tests by responsibility</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s take stock a little bit. We’re trying to fix that bug about multiple mentions of the word “buy”, but first we’re retrofitting unit tests for the premium account behaviour in the Network class.
It will be easier to see what tests are missing if we reorganize the unit tests by Network’s responsibilities.
They basically fall into two categories.
&lt;ruby&gt;
These ones here are to do with the responsibility of broadcasting to listeners, so let’s group them up using RSpec’s describe method.
&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;java&gt;
These ones here are to do with the responsibility of broadcasting to listeners, so let’s group them in a different section of our test class.
&lt;/java&gt;
Now we have our new test, which is about charging for shouts.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_split_the_obscure_unit_test_into_new_pending_independent_tests">Split the obscure unit test into new, pending, independent tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This last one here is a bit weird. It’s sort of about broadcasting to listeners, but it has this odd hack in it which needs further investigation [highlight the comment on the first line] . This test is quite obscure, and seems to be attempting to cover several aspects of Network’s behaviour all at once. Let’s document those individual behaviours as new tests and we can come back to deal with this one later.
Re-organise the unit tests for Person around responsibilities
&lt;ruby&gt;
We can see we’ll need something under the responsibility of broadcasting to listeners to ensure long messages aren’t broadcast for people with no credits, so we can express that using a pending RSpec example. We can fill this out later.
&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;java&gt;
We can see we’ll need something similar under the responsibility of broadcasting to listeners, to ensure long messages aren’t broadcast for people with no credits, so we can express that using a test annotated with @Ignore for the time being. We can fill this out later.
&lt;/java&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s clear we’ll also need to test that we charge two credits for an over-long message.
&lt;ruby&gt;Let’s add another pending example for that.&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;java&gt;Let’s add another ignored test for that.&lt;/java&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Write out two pending specs for the behaviour in the gnarly spec
Once those two tests are implemented, we won’t need this obscure one any more. We’re not confident enough to just remove it until we’ve seen those tests fleshed out, so we can mark it as &lt;ruby&gt;pending&lt;/ruby&gt;&lt;java&gt;ignore&lt;/java&gt; for now. That will remind us we need to come back and clean this up soon.
Disable the gnarly test - we&#8217;ll remove it soon</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_decide_to_split_networks_responsibilities">10.9. Decide to split Network’s responsibilities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point it is becoming clear that Network has too many responsibilities. We have two different sources of feedback telling us this:
With the unit tests laid out by responsibility, we can see more clearly that while broadcasting to listeners is a responsibility that fits, there’s no real reason why the Network needs be responsible for charging for shouts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secondly, the communication protocol between Network and Person, exposed by the mocks, is very noisy: we’re making lots of method calls to Person in order to determine whether they can afford the shout and to deduct payment:
First Sean calls Network#broadcast
then Network asks Sean how many credits he has
then Network tells Sean the new value of his credits, with the fee for the message deducted
then Network asks Sean how many credits he has again, in order to check whether he can afford to send the message!
We could get all sad and angry that if only we’d test-driven this code in the first place we might have got this feedback sooner, but that would be futile: it’s not too late to clean this code up!
How about we make Sean responsible for organising his own payment?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_beginning_the_refactoring">10.10. Beginning the refactoring</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of rewriting this code, let’s see if we can refactor it. When refactoring, it’s crucial not to break existing functionality, so we’ll rely on our tests to warn us if we make a mistake.
&lt;ruby&gt;
cucumber --tags ~@todo &amp;&amp; rspec -f doc
&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;java&gt;
mvn test -Dcucumber.options=”--tags ~@todo”
&lt;/java&gt;
We’ll work in small steps. We may temporarily break some unit tests as the implementation shifts, but the acceptance tests should be passing all the way through if everything goes according to plan.
Ready? We’ll start by moving the deduct_credits method onto Person.
As a baby-step, we’ll make it public, so we can just continue to call it from Network’s broadcast method for now. That should keep the acceptance tests passing&#8230;&#8203; Good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let’s make Sean responsible for deducting his own credits, as he shouts. We can move over this whole responsibility of charging for shouts from the network specs to the person specs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ll need to adjust the test like this…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Move <code>deduct_credits</code> onto Person
&#8230;&#8203;and we’re back to green!
Green: move the call to deduct credits over to the shouter.
Let’s refactor some more.
Because all this code is running within the shouter object now, we don’t need to pass around this instance of Person anymore, and we can access the credits instance variable here, directly.
We can make deduct credits private now.
Make Person#deduct_credits private
We don’t need to pass short enough around as a variable, we can just do the logic inline here.

<p>Great, now the code in Network#broadcast is much cleaner.
We still have these pending unit tests we need to sort out. Let’s start in Person, by fleshing out this test about charging for long messages.
Retro-fit unit test for charging for long messages
That’s better. Let’s just make it fail quickly, to check that we can trust it.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_discuss_the_remaining_network_unit_tests">10.12. Discuss the remaining Network unit tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, now we can tackle these two &lt;ruby&gt;pending&lt;/ruby&gt;&lt;java&gt;ignored&lt;/java&gt; unit tests in Network.
Let’s step back for a second and consider the rule we’re implementing here. This original unit test was simply there to ensure that long messages were not broadcast: remember we originally started out without premium accounts.
With the addition of premium accounts, the rule has changed: We will broadcast long messages, but only if the person shouting has sufficient credits.
To implement it, we’ve ended up with this mind-bending boolean logic in the broadcast method.  It doesn’t have to be like this. This complexity is a sign that we haven’t modelled the problem well enough yet.
Recall that right at the end of lesson 7, we discovered a known unknown in our problem domain and documented it with this question: what happens when you run out of credits?
We know you can’t send a long message when you run out of credits, but what about a message containing the word ‘buy’? Perhaps having a complete answer to this question will help us to resolve this complexity.
Let’s check with our product owner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_document_the_rule_about_running_out_of_credit">10.13. Document the Rule about Running out of Credit</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use a scenario to frame the discussion with Paula, our product owner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given Lucy and Sean are within range of each other - that’s what these background steps do - and Sean has bought 4 credits, when Sean shouts a message containing the word “buy” then… what?
Sean doesn’t have enough credits, so presumably Lucy does not hear his message, is that right?
Right, says Paula.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so in that case, Sean should still have his four credits, correct?
Right again, says Paula.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, thanks Paula. So the rule is that we’ll only send shouts that you can afford. Is that right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Correct! says Paula. A person can’t send a premium shout unless they have enough credits to pay for it.
Now we understand the business rule, let’s automate this scenario and drive out the behaviour.
Decide what happens when you run out of credit</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_automate_the_scenario">10.14. Automate the scenario</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First we need to match this new step where we check Lucy does not hear Sean’s message.
We have a very similar one here for Larry. We can use a capture group to make it more generic. Instead of a wildcard though, we can use pipes to specify the alternative values we expect here.
We capture the listener name, then use that here when fetching the instance of Person.
Make step more generic
Right, now we have a failing acceptance test which should be passing once we’ve resolved this. Let’s have a think about where this behaviour should go.
Only shout what you can afford: Failing unit test
If we give the responsibility for checking affordability to the Person doing the shouting, then Network doesn’t need to care about credits at all, which will simplify things nicely.
Let’s start with a new unit test for Person then.
We’ll set up Sean with only one credit - not enough to afford to send a long message - and assert that the broadcast method is not called on Network. Then we try to shout the long message.
This fails of course, because at the moment Person doesn’t make this check, so the broadcast method is called every time.
We’re at Red in the TDD cycle. Next stop: green!
COMMIT
Only shout what you can afford: Green
To make this pass we need to know how much the shout is going to cost before we send it. That knowledge is in the deduct_credits method, which actually does two tasks at the same time: it works out the cost of the message, and it deducts that cost from the person’s balance.
Let’s tease those two tasks apart, first calculating the cost of the shout, then deducting that cost from the credits.
Red: split responsibilities in Person#deduct_credits
Now we can extract a method that calculates the cost of the message.
Red: Extract method to calculate cost of message
Then finally we can use that method to check whether the message is affordable.
Green: Use cost_of to check message is affordable
&#8230;&#8203;and our unit test is passing. Great.
And I suppose our acceptance test for the affordability rule should be passing now too. It is!</p>

<p>Refactor: Clean up dead tests and code for Network
We’re green, so it’s refactoring time again!
Now we can give that messy old test in Network’s unit tests the treatment it deserves [deletes it] because this behaviour is now on Person. We won’t be needing this pending test.  [deletes it] &lt;ruby&gt; and we don’t need to stub credits here anymore. &lt;/ruby&gt;
Refactor: delete redundant unit tests
Deleting code is my favourite kind of refactoring! Let’s keep going and strip back all that crazy boolean login in Network#broadcast. I think we can just remove this whole clause about the message being too short or having enough credits or whatever. Let’s try it and see what the tests tell us.
Refactor: remove dead code
Excellent, much better!</p>

<h3 id="_refactor_network">10.16. Refactor Network</h3>

<p>Now, can we do any refactoring in Network?

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don’t need to use this shouter_location temporary variable either. Let’s inline it.

<p>OK. The code is nice and clean, and all our tests are passing&#8230;&#8203; except for one: that bug! It can’t escape us any longer. Let’s trap it with a unit test.
We know the responsibility for charging for shouts lies in Person, so that’s where to add the unit test.
Red: add unit test for the bug
Have you already spotted where we need to make the change? Here, in the cost_of(message) method, the code will add five credits to the cost each time it finds the word “buy” in the message. If we change the code like this, it should be working as expected.
Green: fix the bug when charging for "buy" several times
It is! Great stuff.</p>

<p>Although we’ve called this video series Cucumber School, you’ve probably noticed by now that we’re teaching you a whole range of skills and ideas that we on the Cucumber team use to develop software.
Not just skills with Cucumber, but skills with the whole of Behaviour-Driven Development.
BDD blurs the lines between traditional roles like tester and developer. In our ideal world, everyone on the team - not just testers - is responsible for quality, and we all try to test it as much as possible.
Having good automated tests frees up testers to do more interesting interactive, exploratory testing.
We use our tests as a guide to help us design a solution that models the problem well. A better model in your solution can make whole categories of bugs go away forever. We saw that in this lesson when we moved the responsibility for charging for shouts from Network to Person, and the issues around what happened when you run out of credit suddenly became easy to resolve.
Getting the right balance between fine-grained unit tests and broader full-stack tests is critically important to having fast, useful feedback from your test suite. We’ll explore this more in the next lesson.
See you next time, on Cucumber School.</p>
